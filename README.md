## Deepmind's LASER-NV: A Conditional Generative Model of Neural Radiance Fields for Efficient Scene Inference
Summary: A research team from DeepMind proposed LASER-NV, a conditional generative model of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) that can efficiently infer large and complex scenes from a few arbitrary viewpoints, even under partial observability conditions. By combining a geometry-informed attention mechanism with a set-valued latent representation, LASER-NV can generate diverse and plausible views for unobserved areas while maintaining consistency with the observed ones. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate LASER-NV's capability in modeling scenes of different scales and uncertainty structures.

## Fearing for their investments, laid-off Silicon Valley workers sell start-up shares amid plunging valuations
Summary: Due to the economic slowdown, many tech companies have been forced to lay off employees. This has resulted in a sell-off of start-up shares by laid-off tech workers, causing valuations to plunge further. Tech workers had been paid excessive stock-based compensation during the boom, which is now having a negative impact. This article recommends considering investments in profitable tech stocks, such as Adobe Inc. (ADBE) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), rather than unprofitable startups.
