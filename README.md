## DeepMind's Dramatron: AI for Writing Film Scripts with Long-Range Semantic Consistency
Summary: DeepMind has developed Dramatron, an AI tool that assists in writing film scripts. It uses hierarchical language models and prompt chaining to generate cohesive scripts and screenplays with titles, characters, story beats, and descriptions. Dramatron allows writers to edit, compile, and develop their stories while also identifying and filtering hate speech. User evaluations by theater and film industry professionals have shown Dramatron's potential as a co-creative system, though concerns about logical gaps, lack of nuance, and potential plagiarism remain.
