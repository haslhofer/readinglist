## DeepMind unveils Dramatron, an AI tool for writing film scripts with hierarchical language models
Summary: Dramatron, an AI tool created by DeepMind, assists authors in writing film scripts. It employs hierarchical language models and prompt chaining to construct screenplays featuring titles, characters, and compelling descriptions. Dramatron's user evaluation found that writers were impressed by its hierarchical text creation but noted some logical gaps and a lack of nuance. Ethical concerns such as plagiarism and bias were also explored, and DeepMind encourages further exploration of co-creation tools while addressing ethical considerations surrounding language models.
