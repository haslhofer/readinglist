## AI Researchers Develop Method for Personalizing Generative Art by Teaching Models Multiple New Concepts
Summary: Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University, and Adobe Research have developed a novel method called Custom Diffusion to augment existing text-to-image models efficiently. By fine-tuning a small subset of model weights, mainly the cross-attention layers, the method can quickly acquire new concepts with just a few examples and compose multiple concepts together in novel settings, enabling personalized generative art creation. This approach addresses limitations of retraining models and helps mitigate forgetting and overfitting issues.

## Deepmind Introduces Dramatron, an AI Tool for Creating Film Scripts
Summary: DeepMind has introduced Dramatron, an AI tool that aids in the creation of film scripts. The tool utilizes hierarchical language models to generate cohesive scripts and screenplays with titles, characters, plot points, and descriptions of locations and dialogue. Dramatron addresses the issue of long-range semantic consistency often encountered in language models, allowing for more coherent writing. User evaluations revealed the tool's potential for co-creative interaction, though it faces challenges such as logical gaps in storytelling and ethical implications related to bias and plagiarism.
