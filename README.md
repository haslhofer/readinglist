## Unified Image- and Language-Understanding Model Trained Only with Contrastive Losses
Summary: Researchers introduce CLIPPO, a multimodal model composed entirely of pixel-based components, demonstrating its impressive performance on various tasks. Trained solely with contrastive loss, CLIPPO processes both images and text rendered as images using a single encoder. It excels at image-based tasks such as retrieval and classification, rivalling CLIP-style models but with fewer parameters and no text-specific components. CLIPPO's proficiency extends to natural language understanding tasks, outperforming prior pixel-based methods without word-level loss. Surprisingly, it handles visual question answering by simply presenting the question and image together. Additionally, CLIPPO showcases its multilingual capabilities in multimodal retrieval without modifications, highlighting its versatility.
