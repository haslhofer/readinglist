## Deepmind Introduces Dramatron, an AI Tool for Creating Film Scripts
Summary: DeepMind has introduced Dramatron, an AI tool that aids in the creation of film scripts. The tool utilizes hierarchical language models to generate cohesive scripts and screenplays with titles, characters, plot points, and descriptions of locations and dialogue.
