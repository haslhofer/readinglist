## Muse: Text-To-Image Generation via Masked Generative Transformers
Summary: A novel text-to-image generation model named Muse is introduced. Trained on a masked image token prediction task, Muse leverages discrete tokens and parallel decoding for efficient generation. It achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity, outperforming diffusion and autoregressive models. Muse also boasts direct image editing capabilities, including inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing, without the need for fine-tuning or model inversion.

## Deepmind Introduces Dramatron, an AI Tool for Creating Film Scripts
Summary: DeepMind has introduced Dramatron, an AI tool that aids in the creation of film scripts. The tool utilizes hierarchical language models to generate cohesive scripts and screenplays with titles, characters, plot points, and descriptions of locations and dialogue. Dramatron addresses the issue of long-range semantic consistency often encountered in language models, allowing for more coherent writing. User evaluations revealed the tool's potential for co-creative interaction, though it faces challenges such as logical gaps in storytelling and ethical implications related to bias and plagiarism.
