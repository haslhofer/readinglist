## New framework brings language models directly into a broad class of platforms with GPU acceleration
Summary: The MLC-LLM framework enables large language models (LLMs) to run natively on various platforms with GPU acceleration, including mobile devices. This allows for the development of personal AI assistants that can be deployed on phones, browsers, and other devices. It addresses challenges such as resource-intensiveness, memory constraints, and potential optimization techniques required for deploying LLMs.
