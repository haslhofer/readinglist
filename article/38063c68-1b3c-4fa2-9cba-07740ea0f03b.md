## Actions, not arguments, are persuasive and build credibility
Summary: David Heinemeier Hansson argues that actions are more persuasive than arguments in changing someone's mind. He believes that people are more likely to listen to those who have taken risks and seen them through, as these individuals have earned credibility through their actions. He emphasizes the importance of "skin in the game," where one invests their efforts and resources into an idea, demonstrating their commitment to it. This approach, according to Heinemeier Hansson, is more effective in unlocking minds and advancing collective knowledge and understanding.
