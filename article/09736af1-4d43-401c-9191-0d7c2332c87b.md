## Deploy Hugging Face Models on Serverless GPU
Summary: Hugging Face offers state of the art Machine Learning models, such as natural language processing and computer vision. The challenge with deploying these models is that they can be computationally expensive due to being large and requiring GPUs for efficient execution. Serverless GPUs provide a cost-effective solution as they provide access to GPUs on-demand, allowing users to scale their workloads as needed and pay only for the time they use. This tutorial presents a step-by-step process for deploying Hugging Face models on serverless GPUs using a platform called Beam.
