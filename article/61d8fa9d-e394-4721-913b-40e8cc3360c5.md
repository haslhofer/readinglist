## Deploy Hugging Face Models on Serverless GPU
Summary: Serverless GPUs are a cost-effective way to deploy Hugging Face models, which are state-of-the-art machine learning models for various tasks like computer vision, natural language processing, and audio. Serverless GPUs are cloud-based services that provide access to powerful GPUs on demand, eliminating the need for expensive on-premises hardware. This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a large language model dolly-v2-7b from Databricks on Beam, a serverless GPU provider, using a REST API. The deployed model can generate text in response to prompts and can be integrated into frontend applications. While serverless GPUs offer benefits like pay-as-you-go pricing, ease of use, and scalability, they may have drawbacks such as cold starts and higher costs for long-running applications.
