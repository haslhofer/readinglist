## Researchers at the University of Maryland Propose Cold Diffusion: A Novel Diffusion Model Using Deterministic Perturbations
Summary: Researchers at the University of Maryland have proposed a new diffusion model called Cold Diffusion that uses deterministic perturbations instead of additive Gaussian noise. This approach allows for the generation of realistic samples from degraded images without the use of stochastic noise. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on various tasks, including image generation, inpainting, and super-resolution.
