## Ensembling Diverse Large Language Models for Robust and Improved Natural Language Generation
Summary: LLM-Blender, an ensembling framework, leverages the strengths of multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) to achieve superior performance. It consists of two modules: PairRanker, which distinguishes subtle differences between candidate outputs, and GenFuser, which merges the top-ranked candidates to generate an improved output. LLM-Blender significantly outperforms individual LLMs and baseline methods across various metrics, establishing a substantial performance gap.
