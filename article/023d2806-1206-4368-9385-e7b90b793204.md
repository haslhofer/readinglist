## New AI Platform Lets You "Talk" to Your Website
Summary: A new version of Aista Magic Cloud allows users to integrate ChatGPT into their website by copying and pasting a JavaScript tag. The model is fine-tuned by scraping the website's data, generating a custom machine learning AI that can answer questions related to the site. The accuracy of the answers improves over time as the model is reinforced through user interactions and corrections.
