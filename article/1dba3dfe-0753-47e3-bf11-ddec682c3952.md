## LlamaIndex offers 4 Core Techniques to Improve RAG Pipeline Performance
Summary: LlamaIndex has curated a list of four core techniques to improve the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in LlamaIndex. These techniques include decoupling chunks used for retrieval and synthesis, structured retrieval for larger document sets, dynamically retrieving chunks based on the task, and optimizing context embeddings. The guide, titled "Building Performant RAG Applications for Production," consolidates these techniques and provides a comprehensive resource for building performant RAG applications.
