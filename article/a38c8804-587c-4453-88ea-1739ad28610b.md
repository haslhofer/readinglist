## Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs
Summary: Gorilla is a system that allows LLMs to call APIs by generating semantically and syntactically correct API invocations. It is the first to show how LLMs can invoke more than 1600 APIs accurately while reducing hallucination. Additionally, it releases APIBench, the largest collection of APIs curated for training LLMs. Gorilla enables users to train their own LLMs, use pre-trained models, and use Gorilla with other tools like Langchain, Toolformer, and AutoGPT.
