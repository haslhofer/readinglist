## Generative AI: Where Will Value Accrue in the Stack?
Summary: The generative AI market is rapidly developing, with the technology stack comprising infrastructure, models, and applications. Infrastructure vendors, particularly cloud providers and hardware manufacturers, are currently capturing the majority of the value in the market. Generative AI application companies are experiencing rapid growth but face challenges with retention, differentiation, and margins. Model providers have made significant contributions to the field but are yet to achieve large commercial scale. The key question is where value will eventually accrue in the market, and whether strong, long-term moats will emerge. The market is dynamic, with potential for both horizontal and vertical companies to succeed, and the ultimate impact of generative AI on the tech landscape is yet to be fully realized.
