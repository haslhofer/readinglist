## TheBloke Releases AWQ Model Files for Mistral 7B OpenOrca
Summary: Hugging Face hosts the 4-bit precision AWQ model of OpenOrca's Mistral 7B OpenOrca, an efficient and high-performance text-generation model. This model supports inference via various methods, including vLLM, Hugging Face Text Generation Inference (TGI), and AutoAWQ for Python code. The AWQ technique enables faster Transformers-based inference using smaller GPUs, making deployment more accessible and cost-effective.
