## New trick improves retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using embedded "references" to text chunks.
Summary: LlamaIndex has developed a new technique to improve the retrieval capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. Instead of embedding the entire text chunk, the technique embeds references to each text chunk. During query time, these references are fetched by embedding similarity, and the actual chunk is pulled in during the LLM synthesis stage. This method has shown a significant improvement in retrieval metrics, resulting in a 10-20% boost in hit rate and MRR.
