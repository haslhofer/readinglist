## Together Releases OpenChatKit: An Open-Source Foundation for Chatbot Development and Improvement
Summary: OpenChatKit is an open-source project that provides a powerful base for creating both specialized and general purpose chatbots. It offers four key components: an instruction-tuned large language model, customization recipes for fine-tuning, an extensible retrieval system, and a moderation model. The project includes tools to gather feedback, add new datasets, and continually improve the accuracy of the chatbot. OpenChatKit is trained on a dataset created in collaboration with LAION and Ontocord and was fine-tuned on the Together Decentralized Cloud using green zone compute resources. The goal is to create a more inclusive, transparent, robust, and capable open-source foundation model.
