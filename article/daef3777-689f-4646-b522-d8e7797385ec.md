## TextReducer: A Tool for Summarization and Information Extraction Using Sentence Similarity
Summary: TextReducer is a tool for summarization and information extraction that allows users to specify a target text to focus the summary around, resulting in more fluent and grammatically coherent summaries compared to traditional extractive summarization techniques. The tool offers several methods, including reducing a large text to a summary based on a target text and extracting similar sentences to a given text prompt or question. It has applications in summarization, information extraction, question answering, and GPT3/ChatGPT prompting, and can be installed via pip.
