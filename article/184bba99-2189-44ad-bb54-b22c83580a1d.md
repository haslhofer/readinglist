## Create Your Own Private ChatGPT with Your Data
Summary: To build a private ChatGPT, separate your knowledge base from the language model and only generate answers based on provided context. Retrieve the most relevant data by chunking and splitting your data and using embeddings to build your own semantic search. Write a concise prompt to avoid hallucination and use design patterns to improve the relevancy of the retrieved information. This approach ensures accurate answers and traceability, making it feasible to use for Question Answering (QA) purposes.
