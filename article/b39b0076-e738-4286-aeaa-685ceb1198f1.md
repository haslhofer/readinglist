## Lightning-Fast Transformers Revolutionize Large Language Models on Mobile Devices
Summary: Recent advancements have led to the development of Transformer-Lite, a suite of optimization techniques that significantly enhance the speed of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile GPUs. With prefill and decoding speeds reaching 121 and 14 tokens per second for the ChatGLM2 6B model, and 330 and 30 tokens per second for Gemma 2B, Transformer-Lite effectively removes the latency associated with using LLMs on mobile devices, paving the way for the seamless integration of AI into various mobile applications.
