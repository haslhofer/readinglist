## xTuring: Easily Build, Customize, and Control Your Own Language Models
Summary: xTuring is a library that allows users to build, customize, and control their personalized large language models (LLMs). It provides an easy-to-use interface for fine-tuning LLMs, such as LLaMA, GPT-J, and Galactica, on their own data and applications. xTuring enables users to ingest and preprocess data, scale fine-tuning from single to multiple GPUs, explore different fine-tuning methods, and evaluate fine-tuned models. The library supports various models, including LLaMA, GPT-J, GPT-2, OPT, Cerebras-GPT, Galactica, and Bloom, and offers features like low-precision fine-tuning, evaluation metrics, and a UI playground for interactive fine-tuning and inference.
