## Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Informer
Summary: The Informer model can be used for multivariate probabilistic time series forecasting tasks by modifying the emission layer to model the full joint conditional distribution of high-dimensional data. This can be done by using a diagonal emission layer or some low-rank approximation to the full covariance. To improve the computational efficiency of the attention mechanism, the Informer model employs two techniques: ProbSparse attention and distilling. ProbSparse attention selects the active queries and reduces the input size of the attention matrix, while distilling uses 1D convolution layers with max pooling between each encoder layer to remove redundancy in the encoder's feature map. These techniques significantly reduce the computational complexity of the Informer model, making it suitable for long sequence time series forecasting tasks. The Informer model has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on the Traffic Hourly dataset, outperforming other popular time series forecasting models such as SES, Theta, TBATS, ETS, (DHR-)ARIMA, PR, CatBoost, FFNN, DeepAR, N-BEATS, WaveNet, and the vanilla Transformer.
