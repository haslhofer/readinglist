## Stanford Researcher Develops Simple Prompting Strategy Enabling 30x Smaller Open-Source LLMs to Outperform GPT3-175B
Summary: A novel approach called "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) has been developed to improve the performance of small open-source LLMs, allowing them to surpass the performance of GPT3-175B on various benchmarks. AMA involves generating questions based on the input, prompting the LLM to answer the generated questions, and aggregating multiple prompt-outputs using weak supervision. The approach offers benefits such as using imperfect prompts, prompting performance improvements without fine-tuning, and the ability to utilize smaller LLMs effectively.
