## ToolLLM Framework Unveils New Capabilities of Large Language Models to Work with Over 16,000 Real-World APIs
Summary: In this study, the authors present ToolLLM, a comprehensive framework to enhance the tool-use capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, they introduce ToolBench, an extensive instruction-tuning dataset automatically generated using ChatGPT, encompassing a wide range of real-world APIs. To further enhance LLM reasoning, they developed a novel decision tree algorithm for evaluating multiple reasoning traces. Moreover, they introduce ToolEval, an automatic evaluator to assess the tool-use capabilities of LLMs. Experimentation reveals that the fine-tuned LLM ToolLLaMA demonstrates remarkable ability in executing complex instructions, generalizing to unseen APIs, and exhibiting comparable performance to ChatGPT. Additionally, ToolLLaMA exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset (APIBench).
