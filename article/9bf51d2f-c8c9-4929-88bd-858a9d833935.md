## ChatGPT is described as a blurry JPEG of the web, offering paraphrases instead of quotes like Google.
Summary: Ted Chiang proposes that OpenAIâ€™s chatbot, ChatGPT, is comparable to a blurry JPEG of the internet. Due to lossy compression algorithms, ChatGPT often hallucinates by fabricating information or presenting a distorted version of the truth. However, it's proficient at rephrasing information, making it appear like an intelligent understanding. These characteristics may not be suitable for using ChatGPT as a search engine or for generating unique content. Chiang emphasizes that writing original work requires effort and experience, which cannot be replaced by AI tools. While we may eventually develop AI capable of creating good prose, ChatGPT, in its current state, is a blurry copy of the internet, with limited practical applications beyond paraphrasing.
