## EleutherAI and Together Computer collaborate to create GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B language model
Summary: GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 is a 20B parameter open source chatbot based on EleutherAIâ€™s GPT-NeoX. This language model is fine-tuned from instructions on 100% carbon negative compute, focusing on conversation-style interactions. It excels at question answering, classification, extraction, and summarization and adapts well to human preferences through feedback data. While strong, there are areas where improvement is needed such as knowledge-based question and answering, coding tasks, and repetition.
