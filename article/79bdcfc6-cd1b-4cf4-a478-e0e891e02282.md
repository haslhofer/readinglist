## LlamaIndex Provides Techniques to Enhance the Performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipelines
Summary: LlamaIndex has compiled four core techniques to enhance the performance of RAG pipelines in their platform: (1) Decoupling chunks for retrieval and synthesis, (2) Structured retrieval for larger document sets, (3) Dynamic retrieval of chunks based on the task at hand, and (4) Optimizing context embeddings. These techniques aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval and generation tasks, enabling the construction of high-performing RAG applications in production environments.
