## Using External Data, Pinecone Serverless Improves Large Language Models
Summary: The research presented demonstrates that using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the quality of responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama 2, even when dealing with questions that fall within the LLM's training domain. As more data is integrated into the RAG system, the performance of LLMs improves, with a remarkable 13% enhancement in the faithfulness of answers observed in GPT-4 when supplemented with RAG over a billion-record corpus. Furthermore, the study highlights that different LLMs, regardless of their size or complexity, can achieve comparable levels of accuracy and reliability when combined with RAG, democratizing access to state-of-the-art generative AI capabilities.
