## Text2Poster: Laying Out Stylized Texts on Retrieved Images
Summary: Text2Poster is a technique for laying out stylized texts on retrieved images. It involves using a text-image retrieval model to extract text and image embeddings, then using a pre-trained model to predict the layout distribution of the text on the image. Finally, a layout refinement model is used to generate the final layout of the text on the image. Text2Poster allows for the creation of visually appealing posters with customized text and images.
