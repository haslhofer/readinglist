## Combine edge computing with machine learning to build efficient AI systems
Summary: The article discusses the evolution of edge computing, the intersection of ML and edge computing, and the challenges of running ML models at the edge. It suggests an edge-centric approach to building an efficient, scalable edge ML architecture and outlines four design patterns for edge ML architectures: native edge, network local, edge cloud, and remote batch. The approach involves considering device locations and creating a mechanism to configure and interact with them accordingly. The benefits of this approach include high performance, low latency, cost and hardware efficiency, and the ability to run models on any computer. The article also provides additional resources and encourages readers to join a developer community to learn more.
