## A Gentle Introduction to the Machine Learning Models Behind ChatGPT
Summary: ChatGPT operates on the principles of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are trained on massive text datasets to infer relationships between words and generate human-like text. It employs a self-attention mechanism to assign variable weight to surrounding words based on context and a Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback technique, allowing it to learn from human interactions and improve its responses.
