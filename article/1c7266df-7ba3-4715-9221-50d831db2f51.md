## Code Empowers Large Language Models to Serve as Intelligent Agents
Summary: This survey presents the benefits of integrating code into the training data of large language models (LLMs). Code enhances LLMs in code generation, unlocks their reasoning ability, enables structured and precise intermediate steps, and allows them to utilize code compilation and execution environments. These capabilities have led to the emergence of LLMs as intelligent agents, performing tasks that require understanding instructions, decomposing goals, planning and executing actions, and refining from feedback. Key challenges and future directions for empowering LLMs with code are also discussed.
