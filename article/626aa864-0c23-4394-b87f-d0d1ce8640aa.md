## Tech Giant A16Z Releases a "Getting Started with AI" Stack for JavaScript Developers
Summary: A16Z's Infrastructure team created a simple starting template for developers to quickly begin playing with the core technologies of generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), image models, and vector databases, without needing to worry about ancillary concerns like authentication, hosting, and tool selection. The stack includes components like Clerk for auth, Next.js for app logic, Langchain.js for LLM orchestration, and Replicate for image model inference. The team plans to expand the stack with more options and features in the future, and welcomes contributions from the open-source community.
