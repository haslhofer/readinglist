## ModelScope text-to-video generates videos based on English text descriptions
Summary: The text-to-video-synthesis model is a diffusion-based text-to-video generation model capable of generating videos based on provided English text descriptions. With an architecture composed of three sub-networks, it employs a U-Net3D structure to generate videos through an iterative denoising process. The model has limitations, such as biased training data, lack of clear text generation, and limited support for languages other than English. It also presents concerns regarding misuse, malicious use, and excessive use. Additionally, it requires specific libraries for installation and usage, as well as memory optimization techniques for long video generation.
