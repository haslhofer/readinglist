## "Guidance: A New Programming Paradigm for Controlling Large Language Models"
Summary: Guidance is a programming paradigm that offers superior control and efficiency compared to conventional prompting and chaining. It allows users to constrain generation (e.g. with regex and CFGs) as well as to interleave control (conditional, loops) and generation seamlessly. It is faster than chaining, as guidance programs are the equivalent of a single LLM call. It also supports token healing, allowing users to deal with text rather than tokens. Guidance has a library of pre-built components, such as substring and automatic call grammar for @guidance functions. It has multi-modal support and is compatible with Transformers, llama.cpp, VertexAI, and OpenAI. It is easy to write reusable components and has a variety of example notebooks. Additionally, guidance includes streaming support, allowing for the generation of large outputs.
