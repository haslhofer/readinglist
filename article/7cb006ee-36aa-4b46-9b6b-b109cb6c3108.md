## OpenAI's Embedding Model May Not Be the Best Option for Everyone: Here's Why
Summary: The article compares the OpenAI embedding model with the E5 model, a Microsoft-developed text embedding model. It highlights the advantages of the E5 model over the OpenAI model in terms of speed, affordability, and tunability. The article also provides instructions on how to host and use the E5 model on a GCP compute engine instance. The author concludes that open-source solutions like the E5 model can provide better results and more control compared to commercial embedding models.
