## TextReducer: A Tool for Summarization and Information Extraction
Summary: TextReducer is a tool powered by the SentenceTransformer library that enables summarization and information extraction while focusing on a specific target provided by the user, unlike many other extractive summary techniques. It employs a unique approach of "carving away" unnecessary sentences from the original text, resulting in fluent summaries that preserve grammatical features like coreference. The tool offers methods like 'reduce' and 'summarize' for customizing the summary based on the target or overall meaning of the text. Additionally, it supports PDF file processing and has various applications, including summarization, information extraction, question answering, and GPT3/ChatGPT prompting.
