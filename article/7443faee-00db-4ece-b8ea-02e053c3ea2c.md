## Train a classifier with prompts and (optionally) data using Llama 2 LLM
Summary: LaminiClassifier is a Python library that allows users to train and use an LLM-based classifier without labeling data. Users can define classes using prompts, optionally add training examples, and then train the classifier. The classifier can then be used to classify new data, and the probabilities for each class can be retrieved. While the classifier is not perfect, it is a useful tool for quickly and easily classifying data without the need for labeled data or hyperparameter tuning.
