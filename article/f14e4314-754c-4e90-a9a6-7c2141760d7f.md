## GPT-4 Extracts Knowledge from a Video Transcript Creating a Knowledge Graph
Summary: The article is explaining the process of creating a knowledge graph from video transcripts using the powerful text completion feature of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a highly capable AI language model that can analyze text, extract relevant information, and generate structured data. The author used it to extract entities, relationships, and sentiments from a video transcript about sea creatures. The extracted data was then imported into a Neo4j graph database to create a knowledge graph. This knowledge graph can be queried to explore connections between sea creatures, their habitats, and behaviors. The author also discussed some challenges faced during the information extraction process, such as entity disambiguation and handling variations in entity names. Overall, the article highlights the potential of GPT-4 in automating the process of knowledge graph construction from unstructured text data.
