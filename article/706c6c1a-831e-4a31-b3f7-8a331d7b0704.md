Summary: Databricks has released Dolly 2.0, an open-source, instruction-following language model, fine-tuned on a human-generated instruction dataset licensed for research and commercial use. The dataset, called databricks-dolly-15k, contains 15,000 high-quality human-generated prompt/response pairs designed specifically for instruction tuning large language models. The model is based on the EleutherAI pythia-12b model family and exhibits high-quality instruction-following behavior. Databricks encourages the community to use, modify, or extend the dataset and model for any purpose, including commercial applications.
