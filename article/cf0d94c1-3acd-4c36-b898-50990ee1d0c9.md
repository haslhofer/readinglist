## Guidance is a programming paradigm for large language models which allows for constrained generation with selects, regular expressions, and context-free grammars, as well as allowing users to interleave control and generation with conditional logic and loops.
Summary: Guidance is a programming paradigm that offers greater control and efficiency compared to conventional prompting and chaining. It allows users to constrain generation with regular expressions, CFGs, and select options, as well as seamlessly interleave control and generation. Guidance offers several key features: pure Python syntax with additional LM functionality, constrained generation, rich templates with f-strings, stateful control plus generation, abstract chat interface, reusable components, pre-built components like substring, easy tool use, and support for speed, token healing, streaming, and multi-modality. Moreover, Guidance works with various models and endpoints, including Transformers, Llama C++, VertexAI, and OpenAI.
