## New open-source implementation of LLaMA uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for faster training and inference
Summary: Meta has released LLaMA, a collection of large language models, smaller than GPT-3 but with better performance. Nebuly has introduced ChatLLaMA, the first open-source implementation of LLaMA based on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), allowing users to fine-tune their own personalized ChatLLaMA assistants. The library can be extended with fine-tuned weights, optimization techniques for faster inference, and support for packaging the model into an efficient deployment framework. Developers can contribute by submitting issues or PRs on GitHub or joining their Discord group.
