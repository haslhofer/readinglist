## New programming language optimizes prompts for large language models
Summary: LMQL, a programming language designed specifically for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), has just released version 0.7. It enables robust and modular LLM prompting with features such as types, templates, constraints, and an optimizing runtime. Programmers can write queries in LMQL, which are then sent to an LLM to generate responses. The results are directly accessible, enabling the construction of complex prompts with guaranteed output formats. Moreover, LMQL supports nested queries, modularized local instructions, and re-use of prompt components, making it a powerful tool for prompt engineering.
