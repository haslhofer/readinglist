## CogAgent: A Visual Language Model for GUI Agents
Summary: Researchers introduce CogAgent, an 18-billion-parameter visual language model specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. CogAgent is a generalist visual language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-rich and general VQA benchmarks. CogAgent outperforms LLM-based methods on PC and Android GUI navigation tasks using only screenshots as input, advancing the state of the art. The model and codes are publicly available.
