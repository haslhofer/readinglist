## Using LangChain with Cerebras GPT-2.7B: Exploring Alternatives to OpenAI's GPT Models
Summary: This guide demonstrates how to use the Cerebras open-source model with LangChain, providing step-by-step instructions for loading the model with HuggingFace Transformers, creating prompt templates, and integrating it with LangChain Agents. The Cerebras model, a GPT-3-style architecture, offers a powerful alternative to OpenAI GPT. However, due to its limitations, it is not suitable for use as a LangChain agent, as it struggles with complex tasks and understanding abstract concepts.
