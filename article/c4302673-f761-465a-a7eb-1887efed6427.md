## University of Maryland researchers introduce Cold Diffusion, a diffusion model with deterministic perturbations
Summary: Researchers at the University of Maryland introduce a new approach called "Cold Diffusion," which replaces additive Gaussian noise in diffusion models with deterministic and arbitrary transformations. This leads to a generative model capable of reconstructing realistic samples from degraded images efficiently. While the idea of using transformations other than white Gaussian noise is interesting, it requires further investigation to understand its implications for understanding the generative capacity of diffusion models.
