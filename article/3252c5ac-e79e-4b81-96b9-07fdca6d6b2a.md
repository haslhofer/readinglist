## Third-Party Comparison of Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT Language Models
Summary: A third-party evaluation of Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT language models revealed that Gemini Pro achieved accuracy close to but slightly inferior to GPT 3.5 Turbo across various language abilities, including reasoning, knowledge-based questions, math problems, translation, code generation, and instruction following. Gemini demonstrated comparable performance in non-English language generation and handling complex reasoning chains. The analysis identified areas where Gemini underperformed, such as mathematical reasoning with many digits, sensitivity to answer ordering, and aggressive content filtering.
