Using a template for agent instructions, Mixtral can be used as an AI agent with access to tools like "Calculator," "Search," and "Final Answer." The "use_tool" function selects the appropriate tool based on the action dictionary, executing Python code for calculations, utilizing DuckDuckGo for web searches, or providing final answers. Demonstrating the model's proficiency, an example query asking about the current UK Prime Minister is handled accurately, showcasing Mixtral's ability to access up-to-date information via the "Search" tool.
