## Better, cheaper, faster text embedding model, E5, outperforms OpenAI, Google VertexAI
Summary: OpenAI's embedding model, text-embedding-ada-002, is not the best option for everyone. It's ranked 7th on the MTEB ranking and doesn't perform well on many tasks. It also isn't fine-tunable. Microsoft's E5 model surpasses the BM25 baseline on text retrieval and is the first model to do so in a zero-shot setting. E5 is trained on a large corpus of text and code, uses contrastive pretraining, and fine-tunes the output embeddings. The E5 model is also much faster, cheaper, and has better control than the OpenAI model.
