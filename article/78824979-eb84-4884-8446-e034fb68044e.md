## Mask2Former and OneFormer: Universal Image Segmentation Models Now Available in Transformers
Summary: Mask2Former and OneFormer are advanced neural networks that perform image segmentation, a task of identifying different parts (segments) in an image, such as people or cars. Users can create models that can solve any image segmentation task and achieve state-of-the-art results with only one training process, making image segmentation more efficient and adaptable. These models are available in the Hugging Face transformers library, allowing for easy integration and utilization.
