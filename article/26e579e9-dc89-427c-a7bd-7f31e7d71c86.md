## Performing Image Generation with Stable Diffusion via C# and ONNX Runtime
Summary: This repo allows you to infer the Stable Diffusion model, which creates an image from a text prompt, using C# and ONNX Runtime on a Windows machine with a GPU (CUDA or DirectML). It includes instructions on setting up CUDA, cloning the repo, downloading the ONNX Stable Diffusion models from Hugging Face, copying the ONNX files to the project folder, setting the build for x64, and running the project. Additional resources and a tutorial are also provided.
