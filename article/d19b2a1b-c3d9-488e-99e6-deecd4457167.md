## Write small, "atomic" commits for more manageable work that's easier to review and revert if needed.
Summary: In software engineering, an atomic commit refers to the practice of making small, focused changes to the codebase through individual commits. This approach emphasizes breaking down complex tasks into simpler steps, resulting in a commit history that accurately reflects the incremental progress made. This article explains the benefits of atomic commits, including the ability to revert changes easily, maintain a clean git history, facilitate code review, and improve overall workflow. The key takeaway is that by committing frequently and atomically, developers can simplify their work, making it easier to manage and reducing the risk of errors. Additionally, the article highlights the importance of adhering to this practice consistently, emphasizing that even though the concepts may seem simple, applying them consistently can significantly enhance productivity and make the job more enjoyable.
