## AI Researchers Create a Method for Personalizing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Summary: Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University, and Adobe Research have developed an AI method, called Custom Diffusion, which allows text-to-image diffusion models to learn new concepts without retraining the entire model. The method involves fine-tuning a small subset of the model's weights using only a few examples of the new concept, enabling efficient and personalized image generation without forgetting previously learned concepts or overfitting to the new concept.
