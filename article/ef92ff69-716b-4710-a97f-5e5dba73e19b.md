## DSPy: Compiling Langue Model Calls Into Self-Improving Pipelines
Summary: DSPy is a framework that prioritizes programming over prompting to solve the fragility problem in LLM-based applications. It allows you to compile your pipeline to optimize it for your specific task, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering. DSPy introduces concepts like signatures that replace prompts, modules that abstract prompt engineering techniques, and teleprompters that automate prompting. Unlike frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, DSPy focuses on compiling your program and dynamically optimizing the prompts and finetuning parameters, reducing the effort required to achieve desired performance.
