## AutoGen Agents Collaborate to Generate Stock Price Charts
Summary: Using the AutoGen framework, this tutorial demonstrates how to create an agent that generates stock price charts. The UserProxyAgent executes function calls while the AssistantAgent issues the calls but avoids executing them. The tutorial leverages Fireworks AI's function calling feature with two agents: the AssistantAgent focuses on generating function calls, while the UserProxyAgent executes them. Multiple tools are utilized, including yfinance for obtaining stock prices and a tool for displaying time series charts. The code includes decorators that turn Python functions into JSON specifications needed for Fireworks' function calling API. This approach illustrates the cooperative nature of agents working together to achieve complex tasks, such as generating stock price charts.
