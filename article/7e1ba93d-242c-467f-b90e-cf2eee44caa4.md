## Fine-tuning Falcon LLM 7B/40B on a Single GPU with Data Parallelism for Linear Scaling
Summary: This guide explains how to fine-tune Falcon LLM 7B/40B language models on a single GPU using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and quantization. It provides instructions for setting up a conda environment, installing dependencies, and running the fine-tuning script. The results show that training throughput scales nearly perfectly across multiple GPUs. Troubleshooting tips for CUDA errors with H100 are also discussed. The fine-tuning script is based on a Hugging Face Colab notebook and modified for data parallelism. Installation steps are adapted from Hugging Face community contributors.
