## Semantic Kernel: Integrate Cutting-edge LLM Technology Quickly and Easily into Your Apps
Summary: Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with programming languages. It allows users to define plugins that can be chained together and orchestrated with AI. With Semantic Kernel planners, users can ask an LLM to generate a plan to achieve a unique goal. The SDK is available in C#, Python, and Java. To get started, users can run one of the provided console applications/scripts or follow the detailed tutorials provided. Additionally, the Semantic Kernel extension for Visual Studio Code simplifies designing and testing semantic functions. Users can join the community through GitHub discussions, contribute to the project, join the Discord community, and attend regular office hours and events.
