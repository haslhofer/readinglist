## Hugging Face releases an Open-Domain Text-to-Video Synthesis Model
Summary: The "Text-to-Video" model generates videos from English text descriptions using a multi-stage diffusion model that consists of three sub-networks: text feature extractor, text feature-to-video latent space diffusion model, and video latent space to video visual space model. The model's parameters total around 1.7 billion. It has a wide range of applications and can be used for research purposes, but is limited in its ability to generate clear text, handle complex compositional tasks, and perfectly replicate film and television quality.
