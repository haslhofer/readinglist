## Inference Stable Diffusion with C# and ONNX Runtime
Summary: This repository contains the code to perform inference for the popular Stable Diffusion deep learning model in C#. Stable Diffusion models generate images from text prompts by creating a text embedding, denoising a random noise image, and using a decoder to produce the final image. Prerequisites include Visual Studio or VS Code, a GPU-enabled machine with CUDA or DirectML on Windows, and the Stable Diffusion models downloaded from Hugging Face. To run the project, set the build to x64 and press F5 in Visual Studio or use "dotnet run" in the terminal in VS Code. Follow the provided tutorial for more details.
