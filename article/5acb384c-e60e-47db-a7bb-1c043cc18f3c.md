## ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin: Easily Find Documents with Natural Language Queries

Overview:
The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin is a tool that enables users to find documents by asking questions in natural language. It uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to generate embeddings of document chunks and stores them in a vector database. The plugin supports several vector database providers, allowing developers to choose their preferred one.

Features:
- Natural Language Queries: Ask questions in natural language to find relevant documents.
- Embed and Store Documents: Embed and store documents in a vector database using the OpenAI model.
- Multiple Vector Database Providers: Choose from various vector database providers.
- Metadata Filtering: Filter your searches by source, date, author, and other criteria.

Setup:
1. Install Python 3.10, Clone the repository, Create a new virtual environment, and Install app dependencies.
2. Set environment variables: DATASTORE, BEARER_TOKEN, and OPENAI_API_KEY, and Provider-specific environment variables.
3. Run the API Locally.

Usage:
1. Access API Documentation.
2. Use curl commands for upsert, query, and delete operations.
3. Test in ChatGPT: Run locally and follow the instructions to test in ChatGPT.

Customization:
1. Personalization: Update the logo, data models, plugin name, and instructions.
2. Authentication: Choose from four authentication methods: No Authentication, HTTP Bearer (User Level / Service Level), OAuth, and Custom.

Deployment:
1. Update openapi.yaml and ai-plugin.json files with your deployment URL.
2. Consider removing unused dependencies.
3. Deploy to your preferred cloud platform.

Webhooks and Scripts:
- Use webhooks to keep the vector database up-to-date.
- Utilize scripts to batch upsert or process documents.

Future Directions:
- Explore additional vector database providers, develop a user interface, and integrate more optional services.

Contributions:
- The plugin supports several vector database providers thanks to community contributions.
- We welcome contributions for new features, enhancements, and documentation.
Summary: The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin is a flexible solution for semantic search and retrieval of personal or organizational documents using natural language queries. It utilizes OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 embeddings model to store and query document chunks using a vector database, with a FastAPI server exposing the API endpoints. Users can upsert, query, and delete documents, as well as filter results using metadata. The plugin supports several vector database providers, each with different features and pricing, and allows customization of the plugin name, description, and usage instructions. It provides a memory feature where ChatGPT can save snippets from conversations to the vector database for later reference. Authentication methods include no authentication, HTTP Bearer (user and service level), OAuth, and custom authentication. The plugin can be deployed to various cloud platforms and supports webhooks for continuous document synchronization. Additionally, scripts are available for batch upserting and processing documents from different data sources. The plugin has limitations in keyword search, sensitive data handling, scalability, language support, and metadata extraction accuracy. Future directions include integrating additional vector database providers, user interface development, hybrid search, and advanced chunking and embedding strategies. Contributions to the project are welcomed.
