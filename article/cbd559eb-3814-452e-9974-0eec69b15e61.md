## Create Smaller and Efficient Vision Models with Autodistill, a New Distillation Library
Summary: Autodistill, a Python library, enables the creation of computer vision models without labeling any data. It uses knowledge from large foundation models and transfers it to smaller models for enterprise AI applications running in real-time or at the edge. By leveraging this process, users can benefit from the knowledge of large models without the challenges associated with deploying them, such as compute-intensive tasks, slow speeds, and proprietary limitations. Autodistill allows for the labeling of images using a foundation model and the training of a state-of-the-art model on the resulting dataset. This process distills knowledge from a large model into a smaller, faster, and more efficient model with full visibility into the training data and full control over the output. Users can employ Autodistill to create the first version of a model without labeling data, providing faster experimentation and insights into the data used for training, enabling debugging and performance improvement. The library also supports automated labeling, reducing labeling costs and enabling the addition of human input for classes where the foundation model struggles. Limitations include the inability of base models to identify every class and challenges in distinguishing classes with similar labels in natural language. Autodistill demonstrates its capabilities through a step-by-step guide to creating a milk container detection model using Grounded SAM and YOLOv8, showcasing the installation, image annotation, model training, and testing processes. Additionally, users can deploy the model to Roboflow for edge deployment. The article concludes by highlighting the benefits of using Autodistill, including the creation of smaller, faster, and more efficient models, full visibility into training data, and the ability to leverage the latest foundation models. It also encourages contributions to the project's GitHub repository for adding new base and target models.
