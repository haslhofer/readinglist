## Retrieval-Augmented Thoughts Improve Reasoning and Generation in Long-Horizon Tasks
Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Thoughts (RAT) leverages information retrieval to enhance the reasoning and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs) in long-horizon generation tasks. RAT iteratively refines a chain of thoughts by incorporating relevant retrieved information, significantly improving the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and CodeLLaMA-7b across a range of tasks, including code generation, mathematical reasoning, creative writing, and embodied task planning.
