## OMMO: A Large-Scale Outdoor Multi-Modal Dataset and Benchmark for Novel View Synthesis and Implicit Scene Reconstruction
Summary: The OMMO dataset offers a large-scale outdoor multimodal dataset for NeRF-based tasks like novel view synthesis and scene reconstruction. It provides calibrated images, point clouds, and textual annotations for diverse real-world scenes, such as cities, buildings, and natural areas. The dataset is accompanied by a benchmark for novel view synthesis, comparing several state-of-the-art methods and presenting additional sub-benchmarks for different scene types, camera trajectories, and lighting conditions.
