## Future AI models will be tailored to specific data and tasks, with companies developing their own foundation models.
Summary: In the near future, everyone will use foundation models (FMs) similar to GPT-4, but trained on their own data and workloads, similar to "GPT-You" instead of "GPT-X." Closed APIs are not defensible, and the lasting competitive advantage is data. The final mile, which involves fine-tuning and data labeling, creates real value. The more you fine-tune, the more powerful your FM becomes for your data and workloads.
