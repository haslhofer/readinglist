## Deepmind's Dramatron: An AI Tool for Co-Authoring Creative Film Scripts
Summary: Deepmind's Dramatron is an AI tool designed to co-author film scripts with human writers.  It employs hierarchical language models and prompt chaining to create coherent scripts and screenplays, enabling writers to edit, compile, and develop their stories while identifying and filtering hate speech. User evaluations revealed Dramatron's value as an interactive co-creative system, despite concerns about logical gaps and nuance. The tool raises ethical questions regarding bias, plagiarism, and privacy, but it has the potential to inspire the creation of tools supporting co-creation while considering the ethics surrounding language models.
