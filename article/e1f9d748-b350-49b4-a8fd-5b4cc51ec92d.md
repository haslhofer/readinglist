## LlamaIndex Instrumentation: Send Intermediate RAG Pipeline Events to Enhance User Experience
Summary: This tutorial utilizes the LlamaIndex Instrumentation module to send intermediate steps in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to the frontend, providing a user-friendly experience. Using Server-Sent Events, the frontend Vercel AI SDK receives these intermediate events, displaying them intuitively. To set up the system, clone the repository, set the OpenAI key in the .env file, install dependencies, generate the index, and start the backend and frontend servers.
