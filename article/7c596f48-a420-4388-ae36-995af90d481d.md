## A step-by-step guide to prompt engineering techniques for LLMs, as exemplified by GitHub Copilot's approach.
Summary: This article outlines the art of prompt engineering, which is the skill of communicating with a generative AI model. The authors explain how GitHub approaches prompt engineering and provide insights on building LLM-based applications. Large language models (LLMs) have unique capabilities and can perform impressive tasks, such as document completion, conversational search, and code completion. The core of prompt engineering involves the conversion between the user domain and the document domain. The authors present a pipeline for prompt engineering, emphasizing the significance of gathering context, snippeting, dressing up the context, and prioritizing elements. They delve into the process of generating suggestions using AI and the criteria for stopping the generation. Additionally, the article highlights the importance of choosing the appropriate AI model and discusses the GitHub Copilot model selection. The authors also provide tips on how developers can refine their own prompt engineering techniques.
