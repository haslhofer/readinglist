## PyLLMs: Minimal Python library to connect to LLMs with a built-in model performance benchmark
Summary: PyLLMs is a Python library that allows users to easily connect to and utilize various language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's PaLM2. It offers a standardized interface for interacting with these models, enabling users to send prompts, receive completions, and access information about the model's response, such as the number of tokens processed, cost, and latency. PyLLMs also includes a built-in benchmark system for evaluating models on their quality, speed, and cost, allowing users to compare different models and choose the one that best suits their needs.
