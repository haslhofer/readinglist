## Inverse Reinforcement Learning on a World-Sized Routing Problem
Summary: Researchers at Google have developed a new method for scaling inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to world-sized routing problems with hundreds of millions of states and demonstration trajectories. The method uses graph compression, spatial parallelization, and problem initialization based on dominant eigenvectors to enable the IRL algorithm to run on large-scale problems. The resulting policy achieves a 16-24% improvement in global route quality, and to the best of the researchers' knowledge, represents the largest instance of IRL in a real-world setting to date.
