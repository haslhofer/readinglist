## Neural Radiance Fields Synthesize Photorealistic Views of Complex Scenes
Summary:  researchers present a method, NeRF, for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing a continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. With a deep network whose input is a continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location and viewing direction) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location, NeRF synthesizes views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and employing classic volume rendering techniques to project output colors and densities into an image.
