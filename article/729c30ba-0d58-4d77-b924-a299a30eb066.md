Summary: Databricks has released a new open-source model that outperforms other SOTA models, including Meta's upcoming LlaMa 3 and XAI's Grok. The model boasts half the cost, flops, and time while delivering 2x better performance. It surpasses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and approaches GPT-4 on benchmarks, reducing reliance on proprietary models. At $6.2 per million output tokens, DBRX offers significant cost savings compared to GPT-4.
