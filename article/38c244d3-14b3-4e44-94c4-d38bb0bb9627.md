## New AI Assistant Can Answer Complex Questions By Integrating External Knowledge and Reasoning Multi-step
Summary: Researchers propose a novel approach to enhance the performance of multi-step reasoning large language models (LLMs) by combining reinforcement learning with AI feedback. The ReAct-style LLM agent, equipped with the capacity to reason and act upon external knowledge, is refined through a ReST-like method involving iterative training on previous trajectories. This process leads to significant improvements in efficiency, allowing fine-tuning of a small model with comparable performance to the prompted large model, using two orders of magnitude fewer parameters.
