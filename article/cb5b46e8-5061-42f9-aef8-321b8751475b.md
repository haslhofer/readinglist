## ChatGPT's Family of Models Revolutionizes Public Perception of Large Language Models
Summary: The ChatGPT model family comprises various models that have revolutionized the public's perception of Large Language Models (LLMs). The core GPT-3 model is the source of several derived models, differing in size, datasets, and training strategies. OpenAI offers different models such as Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Cushman, which offer a balance between natural language generation quality and inference speed. These models can be fine-tuned for specific applications, such as code generation or text summarization, using labeled data and human-generated completions. GPT-3.5 models, trained on a blend of text and code, showcase additional capabilities. The GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3 models share similarities in architecture but vary in training data size and the number of transformer blocks.
