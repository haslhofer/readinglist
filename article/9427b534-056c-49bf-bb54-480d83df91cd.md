## Massively Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Improved Routing in Google Maps
Summary: Researchers at Google have developed a new method for scaling inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to world-sized routing problems with hundreds of millions of states and demonstration trajectories. They achieved this by using graph compression, spatial parallelization, problem initialization based on dominant eigenvectors and a new generalization of classic IRL algorithms called Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP). The resulting policy achieved a 16-24% improvement in global route quality and represents the largest instance of IRL in a real-world setting to date. This method can be particularly beneficial for promoting sustainable modes of transportation by considering factors beyond journey time in route recommendations.
