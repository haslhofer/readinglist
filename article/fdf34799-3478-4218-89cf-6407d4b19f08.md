## Training Credit Scoring Models on Synthetic Data and Applying Them to Real-World Data
Summary: A new framework is proposed for training credit scoring models on synthetic data and applying them to real-world data, and analyzing the model's ability to handle data drift. The results show that models trained on synthetic data can perform well, but with a loss of predictive power. TVAE had better performance than CTGAN, and there's a cost in terms of a loss of predictive power when using synthetic data.
