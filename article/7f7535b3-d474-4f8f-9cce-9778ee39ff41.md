## Text-to-Image Transformer Model Muse Achieves State-of-the-Art Results While Being More Efficient
Summary: Muse is a text-to-image Transformer model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image generation efficiency and fidelity. It is trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space, enabling faster generation and parallelized decoding compared to diffusion and autoregressive models. Muse leverages a pre-trained large language model for fine-grained language understanding, resulting in high-quality images with a strong grasp of visual concepts and relationships. Additionally, it allows for direct image editing applications like inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing without the need for fine-tuning or model inversion.
