## Principled Instructions for Prompting Large Language Models (LLM)
Summary: The paper presents 26 guiding principles for creating more effective prompts for large language models like LLaMA-1/2 and GPT-3.5/4. The goal is to simplify the process of formulating questions and enhancing user understanding of how different scales of language models respond to different prompts. The principles are validated through experiments on these models, and the project page is available at the provided URL. The paper aims to provide a better guide for researchers working on prompting large language models.
