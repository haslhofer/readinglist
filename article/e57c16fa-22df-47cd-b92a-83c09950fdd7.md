## LLMOps: A New Paradigm for Managing the Lifecycle of Large Language Model-Powered Applications
Summary: LLMOps, which stands for large language model operations, is a new set of tools and practices taken from MLOps to manage the lifecycle of LLM-powered applications, which include development, deployment, and maintenance. LLMs differ from traditional ML models in several ways, such as data management, experimentation, evaluation, cost, and latency, leading to the need for a specialized approach in LLMOps. The field is rapidly evolving and is expected to see significant developments in the future as LLMs become more widely used in the AI industry.
