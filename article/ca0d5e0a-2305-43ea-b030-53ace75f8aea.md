Summary: GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 is a 20B parameter language model, fine-tuned from EleutherAIâ€™s GPT-NeoX with over 40 million instructions and carbon-negative compute. Based on dialog-style interactions, it excels at tasks like question answering, classification, extraction, and summarization. However, it has limitations, including knowledge-based question answering, coding, and creative writing. The model is intended for research, safe deployment, understanding model limitations, generating art, and educational use. Misuse, malicious use, and out-of-scope use are prohibited and include generating fake news, hate speech, impersonation, or spamming. Training involved 2 x 8 x A100 GPUs, 8bit-AdamW optimizer, and 2 x 2 x 64 x 2048 batch size. The model is available on Together Discord and has been used in 91 Spaces on HuggingFace.
