## Calendars Can Be Time Machines: Exploring New Layers and Dimensional Time Management
Summary: Calendars, essential tools for time management, have remained largely static despite technological advancements. They fail to distinguish between different event types, such as tasks, meetings, and blocked time, and lack the ability to integrate data from other sources. This essay proposes introducing native layers to calendars that would allow for the seamless integration of various activities, including Spotify listening history, sleep quality data, and personal activities from the past.
