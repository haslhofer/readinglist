## Hugging Face's Transformers Agents: An API Providing Natural Language Processing Tools Through Large Language Models
Summary: Transformers Agents is an experimental API introduced in transformers version v4.29.0. It provides a natural language API on top of transformer models, enabling users to interact with these models using natural language. The API defines a set of tools and designs an agent to interpret natural language, use the tools, and perform tasks. This agent can be used for multimodal tasks, such as generating images, reading text aloud, and answering questions from documents. It can be extended to use any tool developed by the community. The API supports both single execution and chat-based execution, and users can pass non-text objects as input. Remote executors for default tools are provided for demonstration purposes but are currently turned off. The API includes a curated set of tools, such as document question answering, text question answering, image captioning, and text summarization. Users can also create and share their own custom tools and leverage them with the agent. The API can also return the code generated by the agent, along with tool definition and accurate imports, allowing users to modify and execute the code in different settings.
