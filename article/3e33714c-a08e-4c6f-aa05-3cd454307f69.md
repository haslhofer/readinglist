## Wolfram Introduces New Prompt Repository for LLM-Related Technology
Summary: Stephen Wolfram introduces the Wolfram Prompt Repository, a curated collection of community-contributed prompts for language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These prompts, accessible in Chat Notebooks and programmatically, are the building blocks for "LLM programming," enabling users to channel LLMs to perform various tasks. The repository includes persona prompts, function prompts, and modifier prompts. The Wolfram Prompt Repository facilitates the sharing of prompts, allowing users to submit their own prompts and deploy them for personal use or share them with others. Wolfram discusses the potential for developing a "prompt language" and the progressive evolution of prompts over time. He emphasizes the importance of community involvement in exploring the possibilities of prompts and the exciting potential of the repository.
