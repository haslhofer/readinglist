## RAG: Merging Parameterized Knowledge with Dynamic External Data to Enhance LLM Capabilities
Summary: Researchers proposed a new methodology called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG enhances the accuracy and relevance of LLM responses by integrating external, non-parameterized data. The method involves identifying relevant information from external databases and incorporating it into the LLM's response generation process. This approach leads to a significant reduction in hallucinations and increased response reliability, making RAG-augmented LLMs more adaptable and versatile for various applications.
