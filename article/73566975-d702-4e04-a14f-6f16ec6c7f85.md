## Diffusion Models Course Unit 4: Exploring Techniques for Faster Sampling, Improved Training, Enhanced Control, and Novel Architectures
Summary: Unit four of the Diffusion Models Course delves into various improvements and extensions of Diffusion Models. Training improvements like optimizing noise schedules, diverse aspect ratio training, and incorporating pre-trained models enhance model performance. New sampling and inference techniques allow for editing images with diffusion models, with methods like DDIM inversion, mask-guided inpainting, and fine-tuning on single images. Video and audio generation with diffusion models are explored using spectrograms for audio. Alternative architectures like transformers are also being used to replace UNet architectures for greater efficiency.
