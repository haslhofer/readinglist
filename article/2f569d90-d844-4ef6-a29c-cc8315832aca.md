## Using MinHash Locality Sensitive Hashing, detect similar documents in a database with Python.
Summary: This text discusses a method for detecting similar documents using Minhash Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in Python. LSH is an approximate approach that hashes similar items into the same bucket. The process involves transforming the documents into sets using k-shingling, representing the sets as MinHash signatures to preserve Jaccard similarity, and applying LSH for efficient similarity detection. The article compares this approach to a brute-force method and provides a GitHub link with the complete example. It also recommends various robust libraries for LSH implementation.
