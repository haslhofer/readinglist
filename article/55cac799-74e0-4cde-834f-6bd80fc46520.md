## PyLLMs: A Python library for connecting to and benchmarking large language models (LLMs)
Summary: PyLLMs is a Python library for connecting to large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AI21, Cohere, Aleph Alpha, and HuggingfaceHub. It offers a simple interface to interact with LLMs, including built-in model performance benchmarks for evaluating quality, speed, and cost. The library supports multi-model usage, async and streaming completion, and chat history and system message features. It also provides an automated benchmark system for evaluating models on quality, speed, and cost using predefined questions or custom prompts.
