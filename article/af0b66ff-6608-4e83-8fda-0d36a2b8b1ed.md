## Researchers Propose Cold Diffusion: A Diffusion Model with Deterministic Perturbations
Summary: Researchers at the University of Maryland propose Cold Diffusion, a diffusion model with deterministic perturbations instead of additive Gaussian noise. They show that using deterministic transformations like blur and subsampling can generate realistic images, outperforming classical approaches in inpainting and super-resolution tasks with fixed and deterministic degradation. This approach challenges the conventional notion of starting with a disordered distribution to generate structured objects, suggesting new directions for exploring the generative capacity of diffusion models.
