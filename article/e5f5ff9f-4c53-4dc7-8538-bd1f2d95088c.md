## DeepMind proposes LASER-NV, a generative model for efficient inference of large and complex scenes in partial observability conditions
Summary: Deepmind's LASER-NV is a conditional generative model of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that efficiently infers large and complex scenes from a few arbitrary viewpoints. It generates diverse and plausible views for unobserved areas consistent with observed ones. LASER-NV uses a geometry-informed attention mechanism for maintaining consistency. Experimental results show that LASER-NV models scenes of different scales and uncertainty structures.
