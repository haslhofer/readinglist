## Large Language Models as Tool Makers: Reducing Inference Cost for Complex Reasoning Tasks
Summary: Researchers present a closed-loop framework called LLMs As Tool Makers (LATM) to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to create their own reusable tools for problem-solving, leading to improved cost-effectiveness and sustained problem-solving performance.
