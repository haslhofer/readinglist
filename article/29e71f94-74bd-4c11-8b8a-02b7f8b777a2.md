## Together Embeddings endpoint: Higher accuracy, longer context, and lower cost
Summary: Together AI introduces the Together Embeddings endpoint, featuring 8 leading embedding models, including those that outperform OpenAI's ada-002 and Cohere's Embed-v3 in benchmarks. These state-of-the-art models enable long context M2-Retrieval up to 32k context length and are available at competitive prices, up to 4x cheaper than other platforms. With API compatibility with OpenAI, migrating existing applications is simplified. An example of data visualization using tSNE for RedPajama-v1Â datasets is also provided.
