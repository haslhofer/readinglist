## Microsoft unveils innovative AI model combining LLMs and public ML communities to solve complex AI tasks
Summary: Microsoft has proposed a new approach to artificial intelligence by combining large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT with public machine learning communities such as GitHub and Hugging Face. This combination aims to address the ongoing debate about whether massive generalized LLMs or smaller expert models are better by utilizing both types of models. The idea is to use ChatGPT as an interface to execute numerous HuggingFace text and visual expert models, allowing for complex AI tasks to be solved by breaking them down into subtasks and invoking relevant models for each subtask. With over 120,000 models on HuggingFace, the potential applications for this approach are vast and represent a significant step towards artificial general intelligence.
