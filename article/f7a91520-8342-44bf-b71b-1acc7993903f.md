## Introducing GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16: A fine-tuned language model for dialog-style interactions
Summary: GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 is a 20B parameter open-source chat model fine-tuned from EleutherAI's NeoX with over 40 million instructions on 100% carbon-negative compute. It excels at tasks like summarization, question answering, extraction, and classification. However, it has limitations such as knowledge-based closed question answering, coding tasks, repetition, context switching, and creative writing. The model is designed for research purposes and should be used responsibly and ethically, avoiding misuse, malicious use, and out-of-scope use.
