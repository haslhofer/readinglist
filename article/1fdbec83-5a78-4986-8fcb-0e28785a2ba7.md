## Fine-Tune a Mistral-7b Model with Direct Preference Optimization
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) can only do next-token prediction. To answer questions, they need fine-tuning. This process is flawed as LLMs can be biased. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) provides different answers to choose from. The LLM learns to output the best answer. This method is effective for model improvement. Fine-tuning OpenHermes-2.5 with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) led to NeuralHermes-2.5, which outperformed the OpenHermes-2.5 model. The creation of NeuralHermes-2.5 is explained, including formatting data, training the model, and evaluating it. Preference datasets, DPO techniques, and fine-tuning processes are discussed.
