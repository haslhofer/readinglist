## Chameleon: Plug-and-Play Compositional Reasoning with GPT-4 for ScienceQA and TabMWP Tasks
Summary: Chameleon, a plug-and-play framework, augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with a diverse toolbox, enabling them to compose tools such as vision models, web search engines, and Python functions. It infers the optimal sequence of components to use for generating responses. Chameleon demonstrates significant accuracy improvements over fine-tuned and few-shot prompted models on ScienceQA and TabMWP tasks. It adaptively selects appropriate tools, exhibits rational reasoning, and can infer implicit constraints. Exploring Chameleon's capabilities and developing new tasks are encouraged, with resources and documentation provided.
