## Semantic Kernel: Integrating Large Language Models with Programming Languages for Automated Tasks
Summary: Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into conventional programming languages like Python, Java, and C#. It allows users to create plugins that can be chained together and orchestrated by AI planners to achieve specific goals. The SDK includes notebooks for learning and walkthroughs on the Microsoft Learn site. It offers an extension for Visual Studio Code for designing and testing semantic functions. The project encourages community contributions and provides a Discord community and regular office hours for engagement. The SDK is licensed under the MIT license.
