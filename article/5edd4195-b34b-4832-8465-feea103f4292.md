## Fine-tune Llama 2 with DPO: Aligning Large Language Models with Preference Data
Summary: The blog post introduces a method called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like Llama v2 on preference data. DPO simplifies the traditional RLHF pipeline by eliminating the need for a reward model and RL optimization. Instead, it directly optimizes the LLM on preference data using a binary cross-entropy loss. The post provides detailed instructions on how to use the DPO method with the TRL library, including how to prepare the preference data and train the model. Additionally, it showcases how to train Llama v2 with DPO using QLoRA (Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adaptation) to improve efficiency. The post also includes evaluation metrics and provides access to the trained model on the Hugging Face Hub and the source code for the training scripts.
