## PyMinHash: Efficient MinHashing for Similarity Search in Pandas Dataframes
Summary: PyMinHash is a Python library that implements efficient minhashing for Pandas dataframes. It allows users to find similar records in a dataset based on Jaccard similarity. The library can be installed directly from PyPI or through conda-forge. To use it, apply record matching to a column name of a Pandas dataframe, and it will return the row pairs with non-zero Jaccard similarity.
