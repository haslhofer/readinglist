## Table Transformer: A deep learning model for table detection and structure recognition
Summary: The Table Transformer is a model that excels at tasks related to table structure recognition, functional analysis, and table detection in unstructured documents. It does this by leveraging two DETR (DEtection TRansformers) models, one for table detection and the other for recognizing table structures like rows and columns. The authors provide a new dataset called PubTables-1M, which they use to benchmark progress in table extraction from unstructured documents. They also contribute two models, one for table detection in documents and one for table structure recognition.
