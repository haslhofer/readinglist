## GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B: Open-source 20B parameter chat model, fine-tuned from EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX.
Summary: GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 is a 20B parameter language model fine-tuned from EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX with a focus on dialog-style interactions. It excels at summarizing, question answering, classification, and extraction tasks, and performs well with few-shot prompts. However, it sometimes hallucinates, struggles with knowledge-based closed question answering, coding tasks, repetition, and context switching. Additionally, it's not suitable for safety-critical applications or decisions with significant impact.
