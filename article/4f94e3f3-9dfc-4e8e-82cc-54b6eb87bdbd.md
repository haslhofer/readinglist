## Hugging Face integrates SpanMarker NER with its hosted inference API
Summary: SpanMarker, a named entity recognition (NER) model, has been integrated with the Hugging Face Inference API. This enables users to utilize the hosted inference API widget on all SpanMarker NER model pages and deploy a SpanMarker NER model via Hugging Face inference endpoints. The integration was developed as part of a thesis at Argilla and has been released with the help of Omar Sanseviero and Nicolas Patry.
