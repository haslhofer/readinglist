## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models: From Theory to Implementation

Generative models aim to produce novel images resembling the original dataset. Since the space of all possible images is vast, capturing the underlying distribution function or probability density function (PDF) remains a challenge.

Diffusion probabilistic models address this issue by gradually adding noise to images (forward diffusion process) and then attempting to reverse the process (reverse diffusion process) to restore the original images.

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are a class of diffusion models that introduce a noise parameter to the diffusion process. This noise parameter allows for more stable training and sampling.

To train DDPMs, we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the posterior distribution of the forward diffusion process and the predicted distribution of the noise parameter.

We provide a detailed explanation of the forward and reverse diffusion processes, including the mathematical formulations and key concepts.

The training objective of DDPMs is to maximize the log-likelihood of the generated samples belonging to the original data distribution.

We discuss various approaches to solve the complex loss function, including the use of variational lower bounds and simplified loss terms.

We provide a step-by-step guide to implementing DDPMs from scratch in PyTorch, covering the creation of custom datasets, data loaders, model architecture, training, and sampling algorithms.

We showcase the results of training DDPMs on various datasets, demonstrating the generation of high-quality images.

Through this comprehensive tutorial, we aim to equip readers with a thorough understanding of the theoretical concepts and practical implementation of DDPMs, enabling them to explore and contribute to the rapidly growing field of diffusion models.
