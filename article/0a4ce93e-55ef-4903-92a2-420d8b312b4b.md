## Retrieval Augmented Generation Research Examines Techniques, Frameworks, and Enhancements for AI Advancements
Summary: A comprehensive paper on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) provides an extensive survey of techniques, frameworks, and related research. The paper categorizes RAG enhancements by their components, including queries and data augmentation (input), retriever fine-tuning and metadata filtering (retriever), prompt engineering (generator), output rewrites (result), and adaptive retrieval and iterative retrieval (RAG pipeline). The paper is particularly valuable for those considering developing their own RAG architecture due to its thorough examination of different implementation options.
