## Deep Learning Speech Models Predict Human Brain Activity for Spoken Stories
Summary: Researchers investigated the alignment between human speech processing and deep neural network models designed for speech representation learning. They evaluated 30 speech models, including traditional feature engineering, generative, predictive, and contrastive models, against fMRI brain activation data. The predictive model Data2Vec demonstrated the best alignment with both language and auditory brain regions, outperforming other models. The study suggests that contrastive and predictive self-supervised speech models are particularly effective for brain encoding tasks. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the brain processes speech and provide insights for developing more accurate brain-computer interfaces.
