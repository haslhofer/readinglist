## Open Source 'Chatbot Service' to Chat with 'OpenAI Models' as Assistants
Summary: This repository introduces a service that converts instruction-following fine-tuned Large Language Models to chatbots. It includes an easy-to-use Gradio UI and Discord bot integration. The service supports various models and allows for internet search capability with a Serper API key. To run the Gradio application, use the command `python app.py` and for the Discord bot, use `python discord_app.py --token [discord-token] --model-name [model-name]`. Currently, it supports 2-3 past conversations for context management. The project is open-sourced under the Apache-2.0 license and is hosted on GitHub.
