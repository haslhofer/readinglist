## Table Transformer: A Transformer-Based Model for Table Detection and Structure Recognition
Summary: The Table Transformer model is used for table extraction from unstructured documents, table structure recognition, and functional analysis. There are two DETR models the authors trained for it: the Table Detection model, and the Table Structure Recognition model. These models attempt to recognize individual rows, columns, and headers in tables. The model was contributed to the Hugging Face library by nielsr.
