## Hallucinations in LLMs: Practical Steps to Improve Performance and Reduce Mistakes
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, which occurs when they generate coherent but incorrect or false information. To address this challenge, practical steps can be taken, such as reducing the temperature and providing context to minimize hallucination, decomposing complex prompts into steps to enhance clarity, utilizing self-consistency from diverse model outputs, evaluating models' knowledge limitations, and implementing defensive systems with checks, controls, and explanations to mitigate vulnerabilities.
