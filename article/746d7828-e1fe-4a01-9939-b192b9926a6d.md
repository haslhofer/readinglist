## StarCoder: A New AI Model That Can Assist with Coding Tasks
Summary: StarCoder is a new AI language model developed by HuggingFace to be trained as an open-source model dedicated to code completion tasks. It consists of a base model trained on a trillion tokens and a collection of fine-tuned models like Starchat-alpha which aids in Python code generation and can handle long sequences of code because of its higher maximum prompt length of 8,000 tokens.
