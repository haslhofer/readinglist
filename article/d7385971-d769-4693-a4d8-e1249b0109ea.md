## Visualizing Word Embeddings in Two Dimensions with Principal Component Analysis
Summary: This document aims to visualize embeddings in a two-dimensional space, utilizing T-SNE to reduce dimensionality and create scatterplots. The T-SNE algorithm preserves local relationships in higher-dimensional space, allowing for insights into how embeddings are distributed. Additionally, it discusses choosing perplexity hyperparameter, considering the trade-off between local and global structure preservation. The perplexity value influences how many neighbors each point considers during the embedding process. Higher perplexity values result in more local structure preservation, revealing intricate relationships between points, while lower values offer a broader view of global structure.
