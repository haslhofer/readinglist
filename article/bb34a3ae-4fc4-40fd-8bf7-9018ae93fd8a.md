## Deploy your Language Models in production with Hugging Face Inference Endpoints
Summary: Hugging Face's Inference Endpoints provides a user-friendly and scalable solution to deploy machine learning models to endpoints for easy access through a stable and durable URL. Endpoints leverage powerful CPU and GPU machines to ensure efficient and reliable performance. This article demonstrates how to deploy the "Lord of the Rings" storyteller model, a Bloom-3B fine-tuned on Tolkien's book, which can generate personalized stories. The model runs on GPUs for faster inferences. The project repository is available in the comments section. Philipp Schmid is acknowledged for developing this user-friendly solution that harnesses the power of Language models to solve real-world scenarios.
