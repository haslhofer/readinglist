## LLM-Blender: Combining the Strengths of Multiple Large Language Models for Superior Performance
Summary: LLM-Blender, a newly proposed framework, leverages the strengths of multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) to consistently achieve superior performance. It consists of two modules: PairRanker, which employs pairwise comparison to distinguish between candidate outputs, and GenFuser, which merges the top-ranked candidates to generate an improved output. LLM-Blender outperforms individual LLMs and baseline methods on various metrics, setting a new standard for ensemble-based language generation.
