## One-line headline summarizing the text below:

GPT implemented in 60 lines of NumPy and loaded with the GPT-2 weights, results in text generation and unique insights.
Summary: The GPT architecture consists of: 1) **Text + positional embeddings**: Token IDs and positional information are transformed into embedding vectors. 2) **Decoder stack**: A stack of transformer decoder blocks processes the embeddings. 3) **Projection to vocabulary**: A final layer converts the output into a probability distribution over the vocabulary. Generating text involves autoregressive language modeling, where the model predicts the next token based on the previous tokens. Fine-tuning involves retraining the GPT on a downstream task, such as classification or generation. Advanced techniques for GPTs include GPU/TPU support, inference optimization, more efficient fine-tuning methods, attention-based optimizations, and stopping generation using an end-of-sentence token.
