## MosaicML Becomes Part of Databricks
Summary: MosaicML, now part of Databricks, introduces MPT-30B, an open-source foundation model licensed for commercial use. MPT-30B outperforms the original GPT-3 and other open-source models like LLaMa-30B and Falcon-40B in text and programming capabilities. Additionally, MPT-30B-Instruct and MPT-30B-Chat are fine-tuned variants for instruction following and conversational tasks. MosaicML offers options for customizing and deploying MPT-30B models through its platform, including fine-tuning, domain-specific pre-training, and training from scratch. With MosaicML Training, users can customize MPT-30B efficiently and own the final model weights, ensuring data privacy. MosaicML Inference provides low-latency, high-throughput hosting for MPT and other open-source models, allowing users to send API requests to MosaicML-hosted endpoints for cost-effective inference. For advanced use cases, MosaicML's LLM Foundry provides production-ready training code and supports training custom models of any size on various hardware options. The MPT-30B family is supported by the MosaicML platform, enabling easy and efficient building, customization, and deployment on secure clouds.
