## Fine-tune and Control Your Own LLMs with xTuring
Summary: xTuring is a fast, efficient, and user-friendly library for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-J, LLaMA, Galactica, and more. It simplifies the process of fine-tuning LLMs with your own data and applications, enabling you to build and customize your own LLMs for various tasks. xTuring offers features like data ingestion, scaling from single to multiple GPUs, memory-efficient fine-tuning techniques, exploration of different fine-tuning methods, and evaluation on well-defined metrics. Recently, xTuring has added support for LLaMA 2, evaluation of any Causal Language Model on any dataset, INT4 Precision, CPU inference, and batch integration for faster processing. The library also includes a CLI playground, a UI playground, tutorials, performance benchmarks, and fine-tuned model checkpoints. xTuring has a roadmap for future enhancements, including support for additional model architectures, low-precision fine-tuning, open-source model APIs, and more.
