## Keras Dreambooth Sprint: A Community Event for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Models with Just 3-5 Images
Summary: The document provides details about the Keras Dreambooth event, which involves fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models using Dreambooth on any concept, pushing the model to Hugging Face Hub, filling the model card, and building a demo on top of the model. Participants can submit their models and Spaces in different categories like Nature and Animals, Sci-fi/Fantasy Universes, Consentful, and Wild Card. Prizes will be awarded to the top three winners based on the number of likes given to their Spaces in each category. The event will take place from March 7th to April 1st, with results announced on April 7th.
