## Hugging Face introduces Transformers Agents API, a versatile tool for natural language processing
Summary: Transformers Agents is an experimental API that provides a natural language API on top of transformers. It allows you to interact with a large language model (LLM) using natural language instructions. You can use it to perform a variety of tasks, such as generating images, transcribing speech, and translating text. The API includes a set of curated tools that can be used to perform these tasks, and you can also create your own custom tools. The API has two execution modes: single execution and chat-based. Remote execution is not currently supported and instead, a small Python interpreter is used to execute the code generated by the LLM. The API can also generate code that you can modify and execute yourself.
