## Langflow: An effortless way to experiment and prototype LangChain pipelines through UI
Summary: Langflow, a user interface for LangChain, allows users to create and prototype flows easily. It allows users to drag and drop components from a sidebar onto a canvas to create pipelines. Langflow offers a range of components, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains, which users can link and track the agent's thought process. Flows can be exported as JSON files for use with LangChain.
