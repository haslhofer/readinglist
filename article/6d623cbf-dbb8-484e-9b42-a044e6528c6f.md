## Evaluating the Weakness of Large Language Model Agents in a Complex Android Environment
Summary: Researchers have introduced AndroidArena, an environment and benchmark to evaluate the performance of large language model (LLM) agents on a modern operating system. LLM agents face challenges due to the vast and dynamic action space, the requirement for inter-application cooperation, and the need to consider user constraints. The researchers found that even state-of-the-art LLM agents struggle in complex scenarios and lack capabilities such as understanding, reasoning, exploration, and reflection. Exploration strategies were found to improve the success rate of LLM agents in certain tasks.
