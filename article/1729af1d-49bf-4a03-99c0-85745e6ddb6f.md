## Visualization-of-Thought Prompting Enhances Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models
Summary: Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting, inspired by the human cognitive ability to visualize unseen objects, is a novel technique that enhances the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). VoT employs visualization of the LLM's reasoning traces to guide subsequent reasoning steps. When applied to multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including navigation and visual tiling, VoT significantly improves the performance of LLMs, surpassing existing multimodal LLMs. This finding suggests that VoT resembles the human mind's eye process and demonstrates its potential for enhancing spatial reasoning in LLMs.
