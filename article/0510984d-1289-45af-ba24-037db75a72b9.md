## Open-Source LLMs: Extending Context Length with Blog Post Recommendations
Summary: Open-source LLMs like Meta LLaMa have smaller context lengths compared to commercial models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and Anthropic's Claude. However, there are methods to extend the context length of open-source models either during pre-training or post-pre-training. Two blog posts provide insights into these methods, exploring techniques for extending the context length of LLaMa. Extending context length can improve the performance of open-source LLMs, enabling them to handle longer inputs and generate more coherent and contextually relevant responses.
