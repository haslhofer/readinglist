## Meta AI Research Unlocks Seamless Communication Across Languages
Summary: Meta's AI research project, Seamless Communication, aims to enhance natural and authentic communication across languages. The project introduces a suite of AI models: SeamlessExpressive, SeamlessStreaming, SeamlessM4T v2, and Seamless. These models address challenges in language barriers by preserving expression and intricacies of speech, providing near real-time translation, and serving as a foundational model for universal translation. Meta emphasizes open innovation and responsible AI practices by publicly releasing the models, metadata, data, and tools, while implementing safety measures to mitigate hallucinated toxicity and employing a custom watermarking approach for expressive audio outputs.
