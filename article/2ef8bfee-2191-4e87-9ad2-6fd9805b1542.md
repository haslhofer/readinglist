## Chameleon: Plug-and-Play Compositional Reasoning with GPT-4
Summary: Chameleon is a plug-and-play compositional reasoning framework that augments large language models (LLMs) with various tools to synthesize programs that compose tools and execute them to generate responses. It showcases adaptability and effectiveness on ScienceQA and TabMWP tasks, achieving higher accuracies than fine-tuned and few-shot prompted models. Chameleon adapts to different input queries by generating programs that compose various tools, allowing it to handle diverse tasks requiring scientific knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and table manipulation.
