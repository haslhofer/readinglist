## FrugalGPT: Achieving Cost-Effective and High-Performance with Large Language Models
Summary: Sure, here's a summary:

The research paper titled "FrugalGPT: How to Use Large Language Models While Reducing Cost and Improving Performance" explores strategies for reducing the cost and improving the performance of using large language models (LLMs). It discusses three strategies: prompt adaptation, LLM approximation, and LLM cascade. The paper introduces FrugalGPT as an example of LLM cascade, where combinations of LLMs are used for different queries to reduce cost and improve accuracy. FrugalGPT can match the best individual LLM's performance with up to 98% cost reduction, or improve the accuracy by 4% at the same cost. These findings provide a foundation for using LLMs sustainably and efficiently.
