## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models: An In-Depth Explanation
Summary: This article presents a comprehensive overview of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), including the intuition, theory, and implementation details. DDPMs are a class of generative models that have recently gained attention for their ability to generate realistic images. The article begins by explaining the purpose of generative models and introduces the concept of diffusion-based generative models. It then delves into the forward and reverse diffusion processes, which form the核心 of DDPMs. The article also discusses the mathematical details behind DDPMs, including the forward diffusion kernel, reverse diffusion kernel, and the training objective. Additionally, it provides a Python code example for implementing DDPMs from scratch. Finally, the article concludes by highlighting the significance of DDPMs and their potential for future advancements in the field of generative modeling.
