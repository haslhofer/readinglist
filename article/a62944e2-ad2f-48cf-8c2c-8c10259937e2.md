## Agentic AI Workflows to Drive Massive AI Progress in 2023
Summary: Andrew Ng highlights the importance of "agentic workflows" in advancing AI progress, where LLMs iteratively refine their work through multiple steps such as planning, information gathering, and revision. This approach significantly improves output quality, as seen in a study that showed GPT-3.5 achieved up to 95.1% accuracy in a coding benchmark when wrapped in an agent loop, compared to 67.0% in zero-shot mode. Ng argues that agentic workflows are critical for AI to produce high-quality results that match human performance and shares a framework for categorizing design patterns for building agents, including reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent collaboration.
