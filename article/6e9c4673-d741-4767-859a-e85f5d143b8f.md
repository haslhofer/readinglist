## Text2Poster: Automatically Laying Out Stylized Texts on Retrieved Images
Summary: The Text2Poster framework lays out stylized text from input text elements on retrieved images for poster generation. It consists of three main components: background image retrieval, layout distribution prediction, and layout refinement. The framework utilizes a pre-trained text-image retrieval model to retrieve relevant background images, predicts a layout distribution map for the text elements, and refines the layout to improve visual coherence. The source code, usage instructions, and examples are provided.
