## Hugging Face Researchers Train One of the Largest Context Size Transformers on Long Video and Language Sequences
Summary: Researchers have developed a large transformer model that can process over 1 million tokens of video and language sequences. The model, trained on a massive dataset using the RingAttention technique, improves long sequence understanding and retrieval tasks. The authors also provide open-sourced 7B parameter models for text and video processing, addressing challenges such as memory constraints, computational complexity, and data limitations. This work enables broader AI capabilities for assisting humans by combining human textual knowledge with the physical world's understanding.
