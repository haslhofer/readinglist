## Fine-tuning Donut-base for Document Understanding with Hugging Face and Amazon SageMaker
Summary: This article provides guidance on using Hugging Face Transformers and Amazon SageMaker to refine and deploy the Donut model for document comprehension. The task at hand is to fine-tune and deploy Donut to extract information from scanned documents. The steps are as follows: Set up the development environment, load the SROIE dataset, preprocess and upload data for Donut, fine-tune the model on Amazon SageMaker, and lastly, deploy it on Amazon SageMaker. After evaluating the deployed model, it exhibits an impressive Rogue 1 score of 81.7% on the test set.
