## DSPy: Self-Improving Language Model Pipelines with Programming, Not Prompting
Summary: DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Language Programs) is a framework for building large language model (LLM)-based applications by prioritizing programming over prompting. DSPy allows developers to define pipelines, modules, and teleprompters to handle the flow of information and optimize the prompting process. It includes a compiler that automatically optimizes prompts or finetunes LMs based on the defined teleprompter and a dataset. DSPy aims to eliminate manual prompt engineering and fragile pipelines, making LLM-based application development more efficient and robust.
