## Large Language Models Create Reusable Tools for Improved Problem Solving
Summary: The paper presents a novel framework called LLMs As Tool Makers (LATM) that empowers large language models (LLMs) to create reusable tools for problem-solving. Unique to this work is that the LLMs not only use tools but also generate them, removing the dependency on pre-existing tools. The framework comprises two phases: tool making and tool using, enabling LLMs to craft their own tools and apply them to tackle different tasks. The study showcases the effectiveness of LATM across complex reasoning tasks, such as those found in the Big-Bench benchmark, demonstrating its capability to achieve performance comparable to using LLMs for both tool making and tool using, while substantially reducing the inference cost.
