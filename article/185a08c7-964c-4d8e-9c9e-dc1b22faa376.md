## Toolformer: LMs Self-Taught to Utilize Tools for Enhanced Zero-Shot Performance
Summary: Toolformer is a language model trained to use external tools via simple APIs to achieve the best of both worlds. It can decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. Toolformer achieves substantially improved zero-shot performance across a variety of downstream tasks, often competitive with much larger models, without sacrificing its core language modeling abilities.
