## New Method Assesses Models Trained with Synthetic Data for Real-World Application
Summary: Researchers propose a new framework to use synthetic data to train credit scoring models while maintaining borrower privacy and evaluate the performance of these models when applied to real-world data. They find that models trained on synthetic data perform well but with a loss of predictive power compared to models trained on real-world data. The study also reveals that TVAE outperforms other synthetic data generators, and the cost of using synthetic data in terms of predictive power loss is approximately 3% and 6% when measured in AUC and KS, respectively.
