## MobileSAM: Faster Segment Anything for Mobile Applications and Beyond
Summary: MobileSAM, an improved version of SAM (Segment Anything), utilizes a lightweight image encoder to achieve faster segmentation results. Trained on a single GPU with a small dataset, MobileSAM performs comparably to the original SAM while being significantly faster. It can be easily integrated into existing SAM-based projects with minimal effort. The code is available for download, along with instructions for installation, usage, and ONNX exporting. If you utilize MobileSAM in your research, please cite the provided BibTex entry.
