## Vid2Avatar: Creating Detailed 3D Avatar Reconstructions from Wild Videos
Summary: Vid2Avatar is a novel approach to reconstruct detailed 3D avatars from monocular in-the-wild videos. It solves the tasks of scene decomposition and surface reconstruction directly in 3D, modeling both the human and background implicitly via two separate neural fields. The method utilizes self-supervised scene decomposition to better decouple humans from the background, resulting in superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. It can reconstruct detailed geometry and appearance of the avatars, generalize to different human shapes and clothing styles, and handle challenging poses and complex environments.
