## Guiding Principles for Prompting and Questioning Large Language Models (LLMs)
Summary: The paper introduces 26 guiding principles for prompt engineering in large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-1/2 and GPT-3.5/4. These principles aim to simplify the process of querying and prompting LLMs, enhance user understanding of LLM behaviors, and provide better guidance for researchers working on LLM prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these principles in improving the quality of LLM responses.
