## MetaVoice-1B: A Powerful 1.2B Parameter Base Model for Text-to-Speech
Summary: MetaVoice-1B is a 1.2B parameter text-to-speech model with a focus on emotional speech rhythm and tone in English, support for voice cloning with finetuning, and zero-shot cloning for American and British voices. It predicts EnCodec tokens from text and speaker information and uses a causal GPT to predict the first two hierarchies of EnCodec tokens. The rest of the 6 hierarchies are predicted using a non-causal transformer. Multi-band diffusion is used to generate waveforms from the EnCodec tokens, and DeepFilterNet is used to clean up artifacts introduced by the diffusion process.
