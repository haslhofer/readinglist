## Guidance: A language for controlling large language models
Summary: Guidance is a programming paradigm for controlling large language models (LLMs) using Python. It allows users to construct complex and structured prompts that incorporate control flow, conditional execution, regular expressions, context-free grammars, and other features, enabling precise generation of text and code, constrained generation, and seamless interleaving of prompting and generation. Guidance programs are faster than traditional prompt-based approaches and offer token healing, eliminating the need to worry about token boundaries. It works with various LLM backends, including Transformers, llama.cpp, Vertex AI, and OpenAI, providing high compatibility and the ability to execute guidance programs on multiple platforms.
