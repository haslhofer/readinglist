Summary: Sure, here is a summary of the text provided:

**Summary of the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin**

The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin is a tool that allows developers to create chat extensions for language models like ChatGPT. These extensions give ChatGPT the ability to search and retrieve specific documents or data from a vector database, based on natural language queries or filters. The plugin can be used to access personal or organizational documents, such as files, notes, or emails. Users can refine their search results by using metadata filters such as source, date, author, or other criteria. 

The plugin supports several vector database providers, giving developers the flexibility to choose the one that best suits their needs. It also offers various endpoint integrations for upserting, querying, and deleting documents from the vector database. Additionally, it includes a memory feature that allows ChatGPT to remember and retrieve information from previous conversations. The plugin is open-source and self-hosted, and can be deployed on any cloud platform that supports Docker containers.
