## Catalog and Introduction of Transformer Models: A Journey Through the World of Language AI
Summary: In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive catalog and classification of the most popular Transformer models. Our catalog includes models trained using self-supervised learning (e.g., BERT or GPT3) and models further trained using humans-in-the-loop (e.g., the InstructGPT model used by ChatGPT). Additionally, we introduce and discuss the key aspects and innovations in Transformer models.
