## Hugging Face Hub: Building Image Similarity Systems with Transformers and Datasets
Summary: Hugging Face's blog post presents an image similarity system built with the help of the Transformers library. The system uses the concept of dense representations (embeddings) to compress high-dimensional pixel space of images into lower-dimensional vectors. This helps in reducing computation time. To compute embeddings, a vision model is used, which understands the input images and generates the embeddings. The system computes similarity scores between the query image and candidate images using cosine similarity. It leverages FAISS, which offers direct integration with ðŸ¤— Datasets, to build dense indices for efficient retrieval of similar images. The post also discusses potential extensions, such as dimensionality reduction of embeddings using random projection and locality-sensitive hashing.
