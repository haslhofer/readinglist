## Fast Document Similarity Detection Using MinHash and LSH
Summary: This article discusses a document similarity detection algorithm that uses MinHash Locality Sensitive Hashing in Python to find similar documents in a database. This is useful for detecting duplicate entries, such as duplicate advertisements on a platform. The algorithm works by transforming documents into sets of shingles (substrings of a specific length), representing each set as a signature using MinHashing, and then employing Locality-Sensitive Hashing to find similar signatures. It is shown that the Jaccard similarity of shingle sets is preserved in the signature matrix, making it possible to approximate document similarity efficiently. The article compares the proposed algorithm with a brute-force approach and demonstrates significant time savings.
