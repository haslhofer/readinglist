## Text-to-4D: Generating Three-Dimensional Dynamic Scenes from Text Descriptions
Summary: MAV3D is the first method that can generate 3D dynamic scenes from a text description. It uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that's optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The generated dynamic video can be viewed from any camera location and angle and can be composited into any 3D environment. Unlike other methods, MAV3D doesn't need any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos.
