## "Minimal Training Yields High-Quality Responses from Large Language Models"
Summary: The research paper "LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment" proposes that large language models (LLMs) can achieve remarkable performance by leveraging vast unsupervised pretraining and fine-tuning with a limited amount of task-specific supervised data. The authors introduce LIMA, a 65B parameter LLM trained using only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, without reinforcement learning or human feedback. LIMA showcases strong capabilities in generating responses that adhere to specific formats and generalizing to unseen tasks. Through human evaluations, LIMA is found to be on par with state-of-the-art language models in terms of response quality, even exceeding them in certain cases. These findings suggest that LLMs primarily acquire knowledge during pretraining, with minimal additional instruction needed to align their output to specific tasks.
