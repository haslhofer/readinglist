## LLM App Stack: A comprehensive list of tools, projects, and vendors at each layer
Summary: The "LLM App Stack" repository provides a list of tools, projects, and vendors available at each layer of the LLM app stack. The goal is to be more comprehensive than the original article, which included only popular options based on user interviews. It covers areas such as data pipelines, embedding models, vector databases, playgrounds, orchestrators, APIs/plugins, LLM caches, logging, monitoring, evaluation, validators, LLM APIs, app hosting platforms, cloud providers, and opinionated clouds. Perplexity and Cursor.sh prompts are included for easier searching and markdown table formatting.
