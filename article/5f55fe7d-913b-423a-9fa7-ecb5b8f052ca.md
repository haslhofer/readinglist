## Ultra-fast ControlNet with Diffusers can generate images based on spatial contexts like depth maps, segmentation maps, scribbles, and more.
Summary: ControlNet is a framework that allows for supporting various spatial contexts that can serve as additional conditionings to Diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. It introduces a StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline, which exposes a number of features for controlling the image generation process, such as using a fast scheduler, smart model offloading, and enabling xformers memory-efficient attention, all of which can be applied to different ControlNet conditionings, such as depth maps, segmentation maps, scribbles, keypoints, and more. The ControlNet model can be combined with other Diffusers pipelines and techniques to enable controlled generation.
