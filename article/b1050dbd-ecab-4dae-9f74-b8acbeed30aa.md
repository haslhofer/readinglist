## Instruct GPT-J: Fine-tuned for Natural Language Instruction Following
Summary: NLP Cloud's Instruct GPT-J FP16 is a fine-tuned version of the original GPT-J model, designed to perform well on instruction-based tasks. It is an fp16 model, making it suitable for deployment on entry-level GPUs like the NVIDIA Tesla T4. The model was trained on a dataset created by the Stanford Alpaca team, adapted for GPT-J's fine-tuning format. It requires few-shot learning for optimal performance and can be used with text generation pipelines or the generate() function. However, it requires new lines at the end of instructions for proper functioning. The model exhibits comparable performance to the fp32 version in terms of quality.
