## Graph Path Traversal Enhances RAG for Comprehensive Knowledge-Based Text Generation
Summary: Using txtai's graph path traversal capabilities, this article demonstrates how to collect complex data for advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Building a knowledge base from Wikipedia articles, the author traverses topics of interest to retrieve relevant articles. These articles are then visualized using a graph to show interconnectedness. By combining the collected articles with a LLM (Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-AWQ), the article demonstrates how to generate a short book on English history from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Norman conquest, illustrating the power of graph path traversal for comprehensive context generation in RAG.
