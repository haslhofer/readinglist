## OMMO: A Large Dataset and Benchmark for Outdoor Novel View Synthesis and Scene Reconstruction
Summary: The OMMO dataset is a large-scale outdoor multimodal dataset and benchmark for novel view synthesis and implicit scene reconstruction. It contains complex objects and scenes with calibrated images, point clouds, and prompt annotations. The dataset is designed to evaluate several outdoor NeRF-based tasks, such as novel view synthesis, surface reconstruction, and multi-modal NeRF. It also includes a benchmark for novel view synthesis with state-of-the-art and representative methods. The OMMO dataset is valuable for researchers working on scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, and computer vision.
