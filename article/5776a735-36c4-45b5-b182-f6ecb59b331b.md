## Gorilla: an API store for LLMs that enables them to invoke APIs accurately while reducing hallucination.
Summary: Gorilla is an Apache 2.0 licensed tool that enables large language models (LLMs) to invoke APIs. It can generate syntactically and semantically correct API calls in response to natural language queries, reducing hallucination. The Gorilla OpenFunctions alternative to function calling with over 1,600 APIs is accurate and easy to use. Its repository structure includes data, evaluation, inference, and training folders, and it provides instructions for running Gorilla locally and using it with Hugging Face APIs. Additionally, it has an evaluation pipeline that can be used to reproduce results. Gorilla is a flexible tool that can be integrated with other tools such as Langchain, Toolformer, and AutoGPT.
