## LangChain: A framework for building advanced applications around Large Language Models
Summary: LangChain is a framework built around Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables users to create advanced applications. It consists of different components such as prompt templates, LLMs, agents, and memory, which can be chained together to build more complex use cases. Through LangChain, users can engage in a variety of tasks, including chatbots, Generative Question-Answering, and summarization.
