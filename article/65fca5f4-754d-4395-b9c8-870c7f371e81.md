## Inference Stable Diffusion with C# and ONNX Runtime
Summary: This repository contains a C# implementation for inferencing the Stable Diffusion deep learning model, which generates images from text prompts. To use the model, one needs to download the ONNX Stable Diffusion models from Hugging Face, copy the ONNX files to the project folder, and set the build for x64. The project includes a tutorial and provides resources for further exploration.
