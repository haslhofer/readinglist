## Gorilla: Enhanced API Call Writing with Large Language Models
Summary: A new large language model (LLM) called Gorilla is introduced, which can effectively use tools by making API calls. Gorilla outperforms previous LLMs, such as GPT-4, in writing correct API calls. Additionally, Gorilla's accuracy is not compromised when the documentation for the API changes, thanks to its integration with a document retriever.
