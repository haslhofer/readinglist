## StructLM: Advancing LLMs for Structured Knowledge Grounding
Summary: The StructLM project aims to enhance Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers created a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset and trained a series of models (StructLM-7B to StructLM-34B) based on the Code-LLaMA architecture. StructLM excels on 14 out of 18 evaluated SKG datasets, setting new state-of-the-art achievements on 7 tasks. However, researchers found that increasing model size beyond StructLM-7B offered marginal benefits, suggesting that advancing SKG требует more innovative approaches.
