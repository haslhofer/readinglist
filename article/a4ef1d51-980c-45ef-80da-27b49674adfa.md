## Fireworks introduces FireFunction-v1, an open-weights, GPT-4-level function calling model for faster and accurate decision-making.
Summary: Fireworks released FireFunction-v1, a new and improved open-weights model based on Mixtral. This model offers several advantages over its predecessor, including higher accuracy for real-world use cases, improved response accuracy for multilingual inputs, and the ability to configure "tool_choice" to 'any' to force a function call. It also outperforms other OSS models in terms of speed and accuracy and is available for free during a limited beta period. Additionally, it supports structured output generation and routing decision-making, making it a versatile tool for developers building LLM applications.
