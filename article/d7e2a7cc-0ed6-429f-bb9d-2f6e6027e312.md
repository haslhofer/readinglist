## Introducing Low-code LLM: A Novel Framework for Visual Programming over LLMs
Summary: A novel human-LLM interaction framework, called Low-code LLM, is introduced, presenting a more controllable and user-friendly way to interact with LLMs for complex tasks. It features six types of low-code visual programming interactions that allow users to construct structured planning workflows and confirm them through a graphical user interface without writing explicit prompts. The framework consists of a Planning LLM that designs the workflow and an Executing LLM that generates responses following the confirmed workflow. The advantages of Low-code LLM include controllable generation results, user-friendly human-LLM interaction, and applicability to various scenarios. Demonstrations in four typical applications highlight the benefits of this approach. The framework aims to bridge the gap between humans and LLMs, enabling more efficient and effective utilization of LLMs for complex tasks.
