## Building Reliable Local RAG Agents with LLaMA3 and LangChain
Summary: LangChain demonstrates how to create reliable local Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) agents using LLaMA3-8b. By incorporating techniques from Adaptive RAG, Corrective RAG, and Self-RAG into a single workflow, they show how to build robust local agents that run efficiently on personal computers, enabling users to access powerful AI models without the need for cloud-based infrastructure.
