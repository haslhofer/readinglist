## ViperGPT: A Framework for Visual Inference via Python Code Generation
Summary: ViperGPT is a framework that leverages code-generation models to compose vision-and-language models into subroutines to produce a result for any query. It utilizes a provided API to access the available modules, and composes them by generating Python code that is later executed. This simple approach requires no further training and achieves state-of-the-art results across various complex visual tasks.
