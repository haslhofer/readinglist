## Databricks’ dolly-v1-6b displays high-quality instruction following behavior after only 30 minutes of fine-tuning on a focused corpus
Summary: Databricks’ dolly-v1-6b model shows that a 2-year-old open-source large language model, fine-tuned on a relatively small corpus for 30 minutes, exhibits high-quality instruction following behavior, demonstrating the accessibility of creating powerful AI technologies. Intended for research purposes, dolly-v1-6b is designed to encourage experimentation and understanding of model and engineering limitations. Known shortcomings include handling syntactically complex prompts, mathematical operations, and generating factual responses. Caution is advised when using the model in high-risk applications due to potential biases and limitations arising from its training data.
