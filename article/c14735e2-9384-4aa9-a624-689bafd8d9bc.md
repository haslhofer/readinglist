## Redis Cloud Essentials Available at a Reduced Price of $5 per Month
Summary: Redis Cloud Essentials is available for only $5 per month, providing developers with access to a hub of deployable architectures, including the Redis Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) template. The Redis RAG template, powered by Redis's vector database, simplifies the creation of AI applications that combine the context from structured data with the generative abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This template enables the development of factually consistent, LLM-powered chat applications and supports initiatives like the OpenGPTs project. Developers can leverage this template and integrate it with Redis's AI-native client, RedisVL, to create performant and production-ready AI solutions.
