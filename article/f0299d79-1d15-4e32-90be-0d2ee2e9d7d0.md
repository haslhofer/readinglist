## Smaller Models Outperform Large Language Models with 2000x Fewer Parameters
Summary: Researchers created a method for training smaller AI models that outperformed large language models (LLMs) with up to 85% less data. By utilizing Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, the AI model is guided to generate logical thinking steps, resulting in high-quality labels for training smaller models. This approach significantly reduces the data requirements and model size while maintaining superior performance, even against LLMs.
