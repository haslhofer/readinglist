## Research paper explores combining large language models and knowledge graphs for more reliable and practical AI applications
Summary: The paper titled "Large Language Models on Graphs" offers a holistic view of the research progress and directions for utilizing knowledge graphs to make large language models (LLMs) more dependable and effective for actual deployment. It discusses the interplay of LLM and knowledge graphs in the context of improving LLM performance and addressing challenges such as hallucination and bias. The paper also highlights the importance of semantics, reasoning capabilities, and ethical considerations in integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs. By combining the knowledge from the two papers, readers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits and current research directions in harnessing knowledge graphs to enhance the reliability and practicality of LLMs for real-world applications.
