## Use "references" to text chunks for improved Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Summary: A new trick for improving retrieval in RAG is to embed "references" to each text chunk instead of the chunk itself. During query time, references are fetched by embedding similarity, and the actual chunk is pulled in during the LLM synthesis stage. This can lead to a ~10-20% improvement in retrieval metrics.
