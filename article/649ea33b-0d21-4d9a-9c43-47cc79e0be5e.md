## Muse: A Text-to-Image Transformer Model for Efficient and High-Quality Image Generation
Summary: Muse, a text-to-image Transformer model, efficiently generates high-fidelity images from text. Trained on a masked modeling task, Muse leverages discrete tokens and parallel decoding for efficient image generation. It achieves state-of-the-art results on CC3M, outperforming diffusion and autoregressive models. Additionally, Muse enables direct image editing applications, such as inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing, without requiring model fine-tuning or inversion.
