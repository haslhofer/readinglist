## RWKV Opensource Releases 7.52B Parameter Model Eagle 7B
Summary: RWKV Open Source Development Blog has announced the release of RWKV-v5 Eagle 7B, a 7.52B parameter model that outperforms all 7B class models in multi-lingual benchmarks. The model, built on the RWKV-v5 architecture, is also the world's greenest 7B model per token and has been trained on 1.1 trillion tokens across 100+ languages. RWKV-v5 demonstrates strong performance in both multi-lingual and English benchmarks, challenging models like Falcon (1.5T), LLaMA2 (2T), and Mistral (>2T?). The Eagle 7B model is available for download on Huggingface and can be used without restrictions under the Apache 2.0 license.
