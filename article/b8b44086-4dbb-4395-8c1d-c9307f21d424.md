## How to Keep Your Vector DB Up to Date with the Latest Data for RAG in Your LLM Applications
Summary: To efficiently utilize RAG in your LLM applications, the vector DB must be updated continuously. Here's a guide on how to set up a streaming pipeline to keep your vector DB in sync with your datasets:

1. **Financial News Data Source:**
   - Use a historical API to populate the vector DB with data in batch mode for a specified date range. Parallelize this step to increase efficiency.
   - Implement a web socket to ingest news in real-time. This will monitor financial news 24/7.

2. **Build the Streaming Pipeline Using Bytewax:**
   - Implement input connectors for RESTful API and web socket.
   - Clean, chunk, embed, and insert the documents into the vector DB.

3. **Leverage RAG with an Up-to-Date Vector DB:**
   - When users ask financial questions, utilize RAG to search for the latest news in the industry.

Bytewax and Qdrant, a vector DB, simplify this process.

To ensure data privacy in the pipeline, consider using tools like Snorkel to slice testing data by features and evaluate model performance across different groups.

When comparing multiple training experiments, use a base model as a reference point. Comparing aggregated metrics can be misleading.

Overall, effectively managing and utilizing RAG in LLM applications is crucial for accurate and up-to-date results.
