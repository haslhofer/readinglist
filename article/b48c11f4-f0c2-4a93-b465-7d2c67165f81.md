## Web LLM: Bringing large language models and LLM-based chatbots to web browsers
Summary: Web LLM is a project that aims to bring large-language models (LLMs) and LLM-based chatbots to web browsers. It allows users to run LLMs directly in their browser without the need for server support or specific types of GPUs. The project utilizes WebGPU technology and offers various LLM models, including Llama 2, Mistral, and RedPajama. With Web LLM, users can build AI assistants, create personal AI models, and enjoy the benefits of cost reduction, personalization, and privacy protection. The project provides instructions and a chat demo to showcase its capabilities.
