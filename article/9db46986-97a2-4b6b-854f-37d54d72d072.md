## Efficient Memory Utilization for Large Language Models on Consumer Hardware
Summary: Mixtral-8x7B, a large language model, is too large to fit on consumer GPUs, but a new framework called mixtral-offloading enables efficient expert-aware quantization and expert offloading, reducing VRAM consumption while maintaining good inference speed. This allows Mixtral-8x7B to run on consumer hardware, making it more accessible for researchers and developers.
