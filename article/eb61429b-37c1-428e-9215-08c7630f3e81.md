## Keras Dreambooth: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on Custom Concepts and Showcase Your Creations on Hugging Face Spaces
Summary: The Keras Dreambooth event involves training Dreambooth models using KerasCV, building demos on them, and submitting the models and demos to the Hugging Face Hub. Participants can fine-tune Stable Diffusion on any concept, push the model to the Hub, fill the model card, and build a demo. The trained models must fall into one of four categories: Nature and Animals, Sci-fi/Fantasy Universes, Consentful, or Wild Card. Submissions will be evaluated based on the number of likes they receive on their Spaces, with prizes awarded to the top three submissions in each category.
