## Hugging Face Hub Integration with BERTopic Library for Topic Modeling Management
Summary: BERTopic, a Python library that simplifies topic modelling using embedding techniques, now supports integration with the Hugging Face Hub. This allows users to push and pull trained topic models to and from the Hub, making it easier to share, version, and collaborate on models. The integration also enables seamless deployment and management of BERTopic models in production environments, streamlining the workflow for topic modelling enthusiasts and practitioners. Additionally, BERTopic supports serialization using the safetensors library for secure model management. Users can explore the capabilities of BERTopic and the Hugging Face Hub integration with a starter Colab notebook and examples of pretrained BERTopic models available on the Hugging Face Hub.
