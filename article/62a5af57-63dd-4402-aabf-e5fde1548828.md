## Donut: An OCR-Free Document Understanding Transformer
Summary: Donut (Document Understanding Transformer) is a new OCR-free end-to-end Transformer model for visual document understanding, eliminating the need for off-the-shelf OCR engines/APIs. Despite its lack of OCR, Donut delivers state-of-the-art performances on various tasks, such as document classification and information extraction (document parsing). Furthermore, the paper introduces SynthDoG (Synthetic Document Generator), assisting in pre-training model flexibility across multiple languages and domains.
