## LangChain Standardizes Tool Calling for Enhanced Model Integration
Summary: LangChain has made significant improvements to tool calling, enabling seamless integration of tools and models from various providers. A new `tool_calls` field standardizes tool integration, while a `ToolCallingAgent` enhances reliability. LangSmith provides visual representation of tool formats, and a `bind_tools` method streamlines tool attachment. These changes maintain backward compatibility and aim to simplify and improve the use of tools in LLM applications.
