## Deploying Open-Source LLMs Using Hugging Face Inference Endpoints
Summary: Open-source LLMs like Falcon, LLaMA, X-Gen, StarCoder, and RedPajama have become competitive with models like GPT4 in certain use cases. Deploying these models efficiently and in a production-ready manner, however, remains a challenge. Hugging Face Inference Endpoints is a user-friendly and secure solution for deploying ML models as production-ready APIs. It simplifies deployment, optimizes performance for language models, ensures cost efficiency, and offers advanced security features. The blog post provides instructions on how to deploy the Falcon 40B instruction model, test the LLM endpoint, and stream responses in Javascript and Python.
