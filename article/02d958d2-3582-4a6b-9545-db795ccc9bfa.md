## Databricks democratizes AI by introducing Dolly, a cheaper model that mimics ChatGPT's interactive abilities.
Summary: Researchers at Databricks developed "Dolly," a language model with ChatGPT-like capabilities, by refining an existing open-source model with high-quality training data. Dolly exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities, including text generation, brainstorming, and question-answering, comparable to ChatGPT's performance. The researchers highlight that instruction-following capabilities aren't solely dependent on the latest or largest models, and they emphasize the significance of focused training data in achieving qualitative gains. Dolly's democratization potential lies in its cost-effectiveness and the opportunity for companies to customize and own their language models, transforming LLMs from exclusive proprietary tools to accessible commodities.
