## Hugging Face's Distil-Whisper small model brings fast, private speech transcription to Macs with limited VRAM.
Summary: Vaibhav Srivastav introduces a new model, distil-whisper small, for the insanely-fast-whisper package, which is a lightweight and fast speech recognition model that can be run locally on a Mac with less than 1.5GB of VRAM. This model is particularly suitable for English transcriptions and can be installed using pipx and run with a simple command. However, it is currently limited to Mac users and does not yet support Linux systems. The model's performance is comparable to other speech recognition models, taking around 8 minutes to transcribe a 56-minute podcast episode on a Mac M1.
