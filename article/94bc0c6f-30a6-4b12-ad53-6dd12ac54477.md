## LLM-Blender: Combining Diverse Strengths of Large Language Models for Superior Performance
Summary: The paper titled "LLM-Blender: Ensembling Large Language Models with Pairwise Ranking and Generative Fusion" proposes a framework called LLM-Blender. It aims to combine the strengths of various open-source large language models (LLMs) and consistently achieve superior performance. The framework consists of two modules: PairRanker and GenFuser. PairRanker employs a pairwise comparison method to select the better output among candidate outputs, while GenFuser merges the top-ranked candidates to generate an improved output. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLM-Blender outperforms individual LLMs and baseline methods across various metrics.
