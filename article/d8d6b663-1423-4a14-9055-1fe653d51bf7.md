## BANG: Unlocking Billion-Scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on a Single GPU
Summary: BANG, a groundbreaking GPU-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) method, efficiently handles billion-scale datasets that exceed GPU memory capacity. By leveraging compressed data on the GPU for distance computations and maintaining the graph on the CPU, BANG optimizes GPU kernels and executes concurrently on the GPU and CPU. BANG outperforms existing techniques in most cases, with significantly higher throughputs (40x-200x) for high recall values (0.9) on billion-size datasets.
