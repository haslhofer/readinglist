## ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin allows users to search for personal or organizational documents using natural language queries. It employs OpenAI's text-embedding model to create embeddings for document chunks, which are then stored and searched in a vector database. A FastAPI server provides endpoints for upserting, querying, and deleting documents. Metadata filters enable refined search results, and plugins can be hosted on various cloud platforms. Plugins can also be personalized by adding a logo and adjusting settings. Authentication methods include no authentication, HTTP Bearer (user or service level), and OAuth. Deployment instructions are provided for various cloud providers, and webhooks can be used to keep the vector database up-to-date. Scripts are available for batch upserting and processing text documents. Lastly, potential future enhancements and contributions are discussed.
Summary: The ChatGPT Retrieval plugin is a tool that allows you to search through personal or organizational documents using natural language queries. The plugin uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to generate embeddings of document chunks, which are then stored and queried using a vector database on the backend. The plugin supports several vector database providers, including Pinecone, Weaviate, Zilliz, Milvus, Qdrant, Redis, Llama Index, Chroma, Azure Cognitive Search, Azure CosmosDB Mongo vCore, Supabase, Postgres, and Elasticsearch. The plugin exposes several API endpoints for upserting, querying, and deleting documents from the vector database. The plugin can be hosted on any cloud platform that supports Docker containers, such as Fly.io, Heroku, Render, or Azure Container Apps. A notable feature of the plugin is its capacity to provide ChatGPT with memory by saving snippets from the conversation to the vector database for later reference. The plugin allows you to customize it by replacing the logo, editing the data models, and changing the plugin name, description, and usage instructions. You can choose from four options for authenticating requests to your plugin: no authentication, HTTP bearer, OAuth, or your own authentication method.
