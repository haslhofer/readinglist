## Deploy your Machine Learning Models with Hugging Face's Inference Endpoints
Summary: Hugging Face, a user-friendly solution provider for deploying models in production, has introduced Inference Endpoints. These are stable and durable URLs that can be used to request a trained model. Typically, these endpoints use powerful CPU and GPU machines in a scalable and fully managed manner to ensure efficient and reliable performance. The article describes a project where the "The Lord of the Rings" storyteller, a Bloom-3B model fine-tuned on Tolkien's book, is deployed to generate stories. A simple app built with Streamlit calls the deployed model and assists in writing, running on GPUs for faster inferences. The project repository can be found in the comments section.
