## VoiceCraft: Advanced Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech for Real-World Applications
Summary: VoiceCraft is a state-of-the-art neural language model that enables both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on real-world data. With only a few seconds of an unseen voice, VoiceCraft can effectively clone the voice or edit recordings. It outperforms existing methods in speech editing tasks and achieves comparable results in TTS competitions. VoiceCraft demonstrates the potential for real-world speech manipulation and TTS applications, including voice cloning and personalized audio editing.
