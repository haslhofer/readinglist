## Ehsan Kamalinejad takes you on a journey to code ChatGPT from scratch using reinforcement learning with human feedback
Summary: The video series delves into the inner workings of ChatGPT, providing a comprehensive understanding of its training method known as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). The series aims to implement a minimal yet efficient RLHF pipeline from scratch using only PyTorch, subsequently testing the pipeline on a limited dataset. Ultimately, the series seeks to shed light on ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations, fostering a deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms.
