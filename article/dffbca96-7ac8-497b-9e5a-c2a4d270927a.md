## LLMs struggle with multi-document QA tasks as accuracy falls sharply with an increase in context length.
Summary: In a study analyzing the context usage of Language Learning Models (LLMs), researchers found that LLMs perform best when relevant information is presented at the beginning of the context. As context length increases, performance decreases, and having too many retrieved documents can harm performance. Additionally, extending context length in models doesn't improve performance if the prompt fits the original context. Fine-tuning models can enhance performance by 20% compared to solely pre-trained models, indicating the importance of fine-tuning for specific tasks. The study also emphasizes the potential of combining retrieval with ranking for optimal performance in question answering tasks using RAG. These findings provide insights for improving the performance of LLMs in various applications.
