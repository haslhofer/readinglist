## Two Sigma's New Guide to Large Language Model Abstractions
Summary: This research focuses on the recent developments in frameworks that abstract interactions with large language models (LLMs). The authors introduce a seven-layer abstraction model, the Language Model System Interface Model (LMSI), to classify these frameworks and their separation of concerns. They also identify five families of LM abstractions based on their intrinsic and extrinsic features, which include utilities, community resources, reliability, performance, portability, and extensibility. This article provides a comprehensive review of existing LM programming abstractions and offers insights for developers and framework designers. It also includes a table and a figure to further illustrate the key features and terms discussed.
