## Integrating Memory Layer with GPT Using Function Calling
Summary: A new feature called function calling has been added to GPT 3.5, which enables users to build a memory store in conjunction with a vector store like Chroma. With function calling, LLM is able to decide when to call external functions, pass parameters, and utilize the returned results. The flow of function calling involves sending a prompt to the LLM, including function parameters, specifying if the function should be called automatically, and receiving a completion with a finish reason indicating whether to call the function or not. When building a memory layer, a vector database and cosine similarity are used to store memories in a way that enables semantic retrieval based on similarity. This method includes defining functions for storing, retrieving memories, and embedding text into vectors, which are then stored and queried in the vector database. Through this integration, GPT can automatically decide when to store or retrieve memories based on the conversation context, allowing it to retain and recall information across user sessions.
