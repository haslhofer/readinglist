## Hugging Face adds support for BLIP-2, a state-of-the-art multi-modal model that allows for deeper conversations involving images.
Summary: Multimodal models, like BLIP-2, are emerging in the field of machine learning to enable deeper conversations that involve both text and images. These models leverage open-source large language models and outperform models with higher parameter counts, as demonstrated by BLIP-2's superior performance compared to DeepMind's Flamingo model. This integration of BLIP-2 into Hugging Face Transformers offers exciting opportunities for exploring deeper and more meaningful conversations that incorporate visual elements.
