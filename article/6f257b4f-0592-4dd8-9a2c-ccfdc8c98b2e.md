## Muse is a groundbreaking text-
Summary: Muse is a groundbreaking text-to-image Transformer model that outperforms existing image generation models while being more efficient. Trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space, Muse leverages the understanding of pre-trained large language models to translate text embeddings into high-fidelity images. It showcases state-of-the-art performance, achieving a new SOTA on CC3M with an FID score of 6.06 and impressive results on zero-shot COCO evaluation. Muse also enables various image editing applications, including inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing, without the need for fine-tuning or inversion.
