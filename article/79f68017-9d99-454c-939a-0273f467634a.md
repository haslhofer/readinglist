## Transformers are a type of neu
Summary: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture used in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). They were developed to solve the problem of sequence transduction, i.e., transforming input sequences into output sequences. Transformers consist of encoders and decoders, which use self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms to understand the context of sequential data. They can be parallelized and trained on large datasets, making them efficient and powerful for a variety of NLP tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering, as well as CV tasks like object detection and image captioning. Transformers have been applied to various fields such as medical imaging, fraud detection, manufacturing optimization, and personalized recommendations, demonstrating their wide range of applications.
