## PyMinHash: Efficient MinHashing For Pandas Dataframes
Summary: PyMinHash is a Python library that provides a fast and efficient way to compute MinHash signatures for a set of documents represented as Pandas dataframes. MinHashing is a technique for estimating the similarity between sets of data, and it is commonly used for tasks such as finding duplicate or similar records in a dataset. PyMinHash allows users to easily and quickly find similar records in a dataframe based on Jaccard similarity, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and comparison tasks.
