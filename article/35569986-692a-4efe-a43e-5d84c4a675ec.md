## LLMOps: A new set of tools and best practices for managing the lifecycle of LLM-powered applications
Summary: LLMOps, or Large Language Model Operations, is a recently emerged concept that refers to managing the lifecycle of LLM-powered applications, including development, deployment, and maintenance. LLMs are deep learning models that can generate outputs in human language and are increasingly used in conversational AI, writing assistants, and programming assistants. While similar to MLOps, LLMOps involves unique steps and challenges due to the use of pre-trained LLMs, such as foundation model selection, adaptation to downstream tasks, evaluation, and deployment with monitoring. LLMOps addresses issues like cost, latency, data management, and evaluation, which differ from classical ML models. The field of LLMOps is rapidly evolving, and new developments are expected as LLMs become more prevalent in the AI industry.
