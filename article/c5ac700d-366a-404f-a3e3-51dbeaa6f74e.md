## JPMorgan AI Research Introduces DocLLM, a Lightweight Extension to Traditional Large Language Models for Generative Reasoning Over Documents with Rich Layouts
Summary: JPMorgan AI Research has introduced DocLLM, a lightweight extension to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically tailored for generative reasoning over documents with rich layouts. DocLLM represents both text semantics and spatial layouts, leveraging bounding box coordinates acquired through optical character recognition (OCR) to add spatial layout information. It extends the self-attention mechanism of transformers to capture cross-modal interactions between text and layout. DocLLM has demonstrated significant performance gains on various document intelligence tasks, including form comprehension, table alignment, visual question answering, and key information extraction, highlighting its effectiveness in handling complex document structures and mixed data types.
