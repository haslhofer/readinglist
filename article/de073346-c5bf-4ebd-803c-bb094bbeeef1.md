## Deepmind's LASER-NV: A Conditional Generative Model for Efficient Inference of Large, Complex Scenes with Partial Observability
Summary: DeepMind proposes LASER-NV, a conditional generative model of neural radiance fields. Capable of efficient inference of large and complex scenes under partial observability conditions. LASER-NV can generate diverse and plausible views for unobserved areas while maintaining consistency with observed ones. It uses a geometry-informed attention mechanism over observed views and is evaluated on three datasets: ShapeNet, Multi-ShapeNet, and a novel "City" dataset. LASER-NV shows the ability to model scenes of different scales and uncertainty structures. However, it inherits some drawbacks of NeRF, such as computational cost and the need for accurate ground truth camera information.
