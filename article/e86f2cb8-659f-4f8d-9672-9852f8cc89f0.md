## Open-source framework enables large language models to run natively on phones
Summary: Tianqi Chen, a faculty member at CMU and Chief Technologist at OctoML, released MLC-LLM, an open framework that brings language models (LLMs) directly into various platforms with GPU acceleration. LLMs have become increasingly prevalent due to their generative AI capabilities but are often resource-intensive and computationally demanding. MLC-LLM addresses this challenge and enables personal AI assistants by running LLMs directly on devices with resource constraints.
