## AI21 Labs Launches AI21 Studio and Jurassic-1 Language Models
Summary: AI21 Labs has launched its new developer platform, AI21 Studio, which provides access to its 178B-parameter Jurassic-1 language models for building sophisticated text-based AI applications. The models feature a unique 250,000-token vocabulary, including multi-word tokens, which enhance computational efficiency and reduce latency. Developers can train custom models with as few as 50-100 training examples and utilize them exclusively within AI21 Studio. This platform aims to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technology, enabling developers to build text-based applications that rival those developed in the world's leading labs.
