## Hugging Face Unveils Transformers Agents: Unleashing Natural Language Control over Machine Learning Models
Summary: Hugging Face, an AI platform, introduced Transformers Agents, a new feature that allows users to create agents using Large Language Models (LLMs). These agents can be controlled with natural language and can interact with various data types including text, images, video, audio, and documents. The agents rely on chain-of-thought reasoning to identify their tasks and Python code using provided tools. The toolkit of the agent can be extended with community-contributed tools.
