## Web Stable Diffusion: Bringing AI to Browsers with No Server Support
Summary: Web Stable Diffusion brings stable diffusion models onto web browsers, enabling photorealistic image creation with no server support. This project offers a Python-first environment for model optimization and universal deployment, utilizing WebGPU for GPU executions on browsers. It addresses challenges such as porting models without GPU-accelerated frameworks, leveraging optimized computed libraries, and memory planning. The project also acknowledges limitations like WebGPU's performance degradation compared to native GPU runtime and opportunities for further optimization. The open-source ecosystem, including Apache TVM, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, plays a crucial role in this project's development.
