## LLM Agent Improves Multi-Step Reasoning Through Self-Training and Distillation Loop
Summary: Researchers have developed a new AI agent called ReST-ReAct LLM, which combines a large language model (LLM) with the ability to retrieve and act upon external knowledge. The agent is trained through an iterative process, where it learns from its previous mistakes and continuously improves its performance on challenging compositional question-answering tasks, achieving comparable results to a large model with significantly fewer parameters.
