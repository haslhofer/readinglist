## Large Language Models as Tool Makers: A Framework for Creating and Using Reusable Tools for Problem-Solving
Summary: The paper presents LATM, a framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to create their own reusable tools for problem-solving. It involves two phases: tool making, where an LLM generates tools as Python utility functions, and tool using, where another LLM applies these tools to solve problems. The approach enables cost-effectiveness by assigning tool making to more capable but resource-intensive models and tool using to lightweight and cost-effective models. Experiments show that LATM achieves performance comparable to using a single LLM for both tool making and using, while significantly reducing inference costs.
