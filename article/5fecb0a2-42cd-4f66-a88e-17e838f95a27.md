## The ChatGPT Models Family: A Comprehensive Overview
Summary: The ChatGPT language model family has revolutionized public perception of large language models (LLMs). The GPT-3 family includes various models like Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Cushman, which differ in size, data used, and training strategy. GPT-3 models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as code generation or text summarization. The GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3 architectures are similar, but the training data and number of transformer blocks vary. Additionally, ChatGPT, a sibling model to InstructGPT, is trained on a blend of text and code data and leverages the text-davinci-003 model as its seed.
