## Locality-sensitive hashing applied to find string similarity with potential typos and edit distance threshold
Summary: Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) provides an approximate method for matching strings with potential typos. By representing strings as vectors and applying a sliding window, LSH identifies candidate pairs for further evaluation. The Python datasketch library includes a MinHashLSH implementation optimized for Jaccard similarity, which can be used to find similar strings with a customizable threshold. This approach reduces the computational complexity for large datasets, making it a suitable technique for approximate string matching in scenarios where typos may exist.
