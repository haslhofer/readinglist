## Google Brain and Tel Aviv University Researchers Develop Text-to-Image Model Guided by Sketches
Summary: Researchers from Google Brain and Tel Aviv University have proposed a novel method for guiding the inference process of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models using sketches. By training a Latent Edge Predictor (LEP), they can generate realistic images that adhere to the given sketch outline. This approach enables more precise control over the spatial characteristics of the synthesized images, opening up new possibilities for creative image generation and editing.
