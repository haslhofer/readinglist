## LMQL, a programming language for LLMs, now features nested queries for modularized prompting.
Summary: LMQL is a programming language for large language models (LLMs) that provides a robust and modular way to prompt LLMs. It allows for the use of types, templates, and constraints, and features an optimizing runtime. LMQL queries are implemented using Python control flow and string interpolation for prompt construction and generation. Additionally, LMQL supports nested queries, enabling modularized local instructions and prompt component reuse. It has a cross-backend compatibility, allowing users to switch between backends with a single line of code.
