## A Survey of Large Language Models
Summary: Language modeling has seen a paradigm shift with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), which have demonstrated advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. These models are trained on vast corpora and exhibit remarkable performance on diverse NLP tasks. By focusing on four aspects, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation, researchers can effectively develop LLMs. Extensive work in this domain has led to groundbreaking advancements, exemplified by the launch of ChatGPT, which has garnered significant attention for its innovative capabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress, key findings, and mainstream techniques in LLMs, highlighting their impact on shaping the AI landscape and revolutionizing how we leverage AI algorithms.
