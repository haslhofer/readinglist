## An In-depth Guide to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models: From Theory to Implementation

Diffusion probabilistic models, especially denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), are gaining popularity in image generation tasks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding DDPMs, covering the theory behind them, the mathematics involved, and practical implementation details. The goal is to enable readers to create and train DDPMs from scratch.

The article begins by explaining the need for generative models, highlighting their role in creating new images that represent a specific dataset. It then introduces diffusion models, which generate images by adding noise to existing images until they become unrecognizable. The reverse process involves gradually denoising the noisy images to recover the original data distribution.

The mathematical details section delves into the forward and reverse diffusion processes, defining the probability distributions and transition functions used. The authors of DDPMs reformulated the kernel to allow direct sampling at arbitrary timesteps, making the process more efficient.

The training objective and loss function for DDPMs are derived, leading to a simplified loss function that involves minimizing the mean squared error between the added noise in the forward process and the noise predicted by the model. This simplified loss function is a significant contribution of the DDPM paper.

The article provides a detailed walkthrough of implementing DDPMs from scratch in PyTorch. It covers creating PyTorch dataset and dataloader classes, visualizing the dataset, defining the model architecture, and implementing the forward diffusion process.

The training and sampling algorithms used in DDPMs are explained, including the forward-backward pass for training and the reverse diffusion process for inference. The article also includes code for performing the reverse diffusion process, allowing readers to generate images using the trained model.

Finally, the article provides a summary of the key concepts and techniques covered, emphasizing the importance of diffusion models in image generation. It encourages readers to share their thoughts and questions about the topic and to engage in conversations about the future of diffusion models.

Overall, this comprehensive guide provides a thorough understanding of DDPMs, from theory to implementation, enabling readers to create and train their own DDPMs for image generation tasks.
Summary: In the field of generative models, the aim is to generate new images that are similar to or representative of a given set of images. However, the space of all possible images is enormous, and a generative model must learn the specific distribution or subspace that the training set belongs to in order to generate meaningful images. The probability distribution function (PDF) or probability density function (PD) that captures this data subspace is typically unknown and complex.

Diffusion probabilistic models are a type of generative model that are inspired by a concept from non-equilibrium statistical physics, which states that one distribution can be gradually converted into another by using a Markov chain. Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data by decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders.

In diffusion probabilistic models, the forward process involves slowly and iteratively adding noise to the images in the training set until they become unrecognizable, effectively transforming the complex data distribution into a simpler one. The reverse process then attempts to reverse the forward corruption by gradually removing the noise and returning to the data subspace.

The key contribution of the paper "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (DDPMs) is the formulation of a simplified loss function that is based on minimizing the mean squared error between the noise added in the forward process and the noise predicted by the model during the reverse process. This simplified loss function makes DDPMs easy to train and highly effective for image generation.

DDPMs have been widely used in recent years to generate high-quality images, and they have served as the foundation for several cutting-edge image generation systems, including DALL-E 2, Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney.
