## MiniGPT-4, an Enhanced Large Language Model for Superior Vision-Language Comprehension
Summary: MiniGPT-4 and MiniGPT-v2 are enhanced large language models (LLMs) designed for vision-language multi-task learning. They utilize advanced LLMs like Llama2 Chat 7B, Vicuna V0 13B, and Vicuna V0 7B. The models feature a user-friendly interface for generating text based on images and answering questions in a conversational manner. The project provides instructions on setting up the environment, preparing pretrained LLM weights and model checkpoints, launching a local demo, and training and evaluating the models. Additionally, the code is open-source and licensed under BSD 3-Clause and is based on Lavis, another open-source project.
