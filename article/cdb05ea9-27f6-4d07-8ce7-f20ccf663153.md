## AI's Future: Each Company Will Have Its Own "GPT-You," Not a Generic "GPT-X"
Summary: In the near future, everyone will likely use foundation models tailored to their own data and tasks, known as "GPT-You" rather than generic models like GPT-X. Closed APIs for these models are not sustainable, and data will be the key differentiator. The true value lies in fine-tuning models with labeled data, which can significantly outperform general-purpose models. Developing this data is challenging but essential for building powerful AI models.
