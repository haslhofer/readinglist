## NVIDIA Broadcast 1.4 Adds Eye Contact, Vignette, and Enhanced Virtual Background Effects
Summary: NVIDIA Broadcast 1.4 introduces two new exciting effects, Eye Contact and Vignette, with virtual background enhancements and other updates. Eye Contact simulates eye contact with the camera by estimating and aligning gaze, while Vignette combines with the background blur effect for an AI-simulated bokeh visual on the webcam. The updated virtual background effects offer temporal information for better segmentation and stability, reducing background elements popping in and out. The update also includes a camera mirroring option, the ability to take webcam screenshots, and developer integrations with NVIDIA Maxine SDKs for apps.
