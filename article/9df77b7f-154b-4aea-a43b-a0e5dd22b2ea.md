## Instruct GPT-J is a fine-tuned
Summary: Instruct GPT-J is a fine-tuned version of the GPT-J model optimized for "instruct" tasks. It demonstrates GPT-J's capability as an "instruct" model when appropriately fine-tuned and can be used in natural language for tasks like text correction and instruction generation. The model is available in fp16 format, making it easier to deploy on entry-level GPUs like NVIDIA Tesla T4. The fine-tuning process involved reworking a dataset created by the Stanford Alpaca team and utilizing few-shot learning techniques for advanced use cases. The model can be used with either a text generation pipeline or the generate() function, and special attention should be paid to using new lines at the end of instructions for optimal results.
