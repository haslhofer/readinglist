## LLM Classifier: Instantly classify data with Lamini & Llama 2
Summary: LaminiClassifier is a Python library and command-line tool that allows users to train and use an LLM (Large Language Model) to classify any type of data without labeling any data. Users can define classes using prompts or add training examples to improve accuracy. The tool converts prompts into piles of data using Llama 2 LLM and finetunes another LLM to distinguish between each pile of data. It can classify a list of strings and return predictions and probabilities. The library also includes functions for saving and loading models.
