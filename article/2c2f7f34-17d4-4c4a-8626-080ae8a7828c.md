## The Informer model is introduced as an AAAI21 best paper which is now available in ðŸ¤— Transformers. This blog illustrates how to use the Informer model for multivariate probabilistic forecasting.
Summary: The Informer model is a multivariate probabilistic time series forecasting model that achieves state-of-the-art results on the Monash Time Series Forecasting Repository. It is based on the vanilla Transformer model, but with two major improvements: ProbSparse attention and the Distilling operation. ProbSparse attention reduces the computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism from \(O(T^2 D)\) to \(O(T \log T)\), where \(T\) is the time series length and \(D\) is the dimension of the hidden states. The Distilling operation reduces the memory usage of the model from \(O(N T^2)\) to \(O(N \cdot T \log T)\), where \(N\) is the number of encoder/decoder layers. Informer is available in the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and can be trained on custom multivariate time series datasets using the GluonTS library. It is a promising model for tasks such as traffic forecasting, energy demand forecasting, and financial time series forecasting.
