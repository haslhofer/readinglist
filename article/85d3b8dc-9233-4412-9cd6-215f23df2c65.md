## "ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin lets you search personal or organizational documents using natural language queries through OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model."
Summary: The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin is an open-source tool that enables semantic search and retrieval of personal or organizational documents using natural language queries. It utilizes OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to generate embeddings of document chunks and stores and queries them using a vector database on the backend. Developers can choose from various vector database providers and deploy the plugin on any cloud platform that supports Docker containers. Webhooks can be used to keep the vector database updated with the latest documents. The plugin offers features like memory, allowing ChatGPT to store snippets from conversations to the vector database for later reference. It also allows users to refine their search results using metadata filters. The plugin provides an API for upserting, querying, and deleting documents. The documentation includes examples of API requests and responses. The plugin can be customized by replacing the logo, editing data models, changing plugin name and description, and enabling ChatGPT to save information from conversations. Various authentication methods are available to secure the plugin, including no authentication, HTTP Bearer, OAuth, and service-level HTTP. Deployment instructions are provided for different cloud providers, requiring updates to the plugin's manifest and OpenAPI schema. Developers can also install and use the plugin as a developer plugin by following the steps outlined in the documentation. The plugin supports batch upsert and processing of text documents using scripts. The scripts allow for the extraction of metadata and screening for PII. Limitations include keyword search limitations, sensitive data handling, scalability concerns, language support, and metadata extraction and PII detection inaccuracies. Future directions for the plugin include integrating more vector database providers, expanding scripts, developing a user interface, implementing hybrid search or TF-IDF options, improving chunking strategies and embedding calculations, allowing custom metadata, and integrating additional optional services. The documentation acknowledges contributions from various individuals and highlights that the plugin is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community.
