## Beijing researchers propose TPV, an open-source method for autonomous driving based on 3D perception
Summary: TPV, a novel vision-centric autonomous driving approach based on a tri-perspective view representation, was developed by researchers in Beijing. The TPVFormer transformer-based encoder enables comparable performance to LiDAR methods with significantly less training data and GPU hours. Its key features include predicting the semantic occupancy of all voxels and employing a novel tri-perspective view representation strategy.
