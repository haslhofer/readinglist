## LangChain Releases Video on Query Routing for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Summary: LangChain's "RAG From Scratch" video series addresses routing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Routing involves selecting the appropriate data source or prompt based on a user query. Logical routing employs an LLM to reason about the query and choose a datastore, while semantic routing embeds the query and a set of prompts, selecting the most relevant prompt based on similarity. Routing in RAG ensures that user queries are directed to the most appropriate source for accurate and comprehensive answers, leveraging the knowledge of LLMs and external databases.
