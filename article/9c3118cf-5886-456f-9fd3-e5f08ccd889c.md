## ViperGPT: Composing Vision-and-Language Models for Visual Reasoning
Summary: ViperGPT is a framework that utilizes code-generation models to compose vision-and-language models into subroutines to produce a result for any query. It leverages a provided API to access available modules, composes them by generating Python code that is later executed, and achieves state-of-the-art results across various complex visual tasks without requiring further training.
