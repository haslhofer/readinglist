## Google Gemini and OpenAI Q*: Reshaping Generative AI Research
Summary: The survey explores the evolving landscape of generative AI, focusing on Mixture of Experts (MoE), multimodal learning, and progress towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It examines the impacts of Google's Gemini and the anticipated OpenAI Q* project, assessing computational challenges, scalability, real-world implications, and the emerging academic challenges of AI-themed and AI-generated preprints. The study highlights the importance of ethical and human-centric approaches in AI development and outlines a strategy for future AI research that emphasizes balanced and conscientious use of MoE, multimodality, and AGI.
