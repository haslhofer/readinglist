## New AI Technique Enables Personalized Art Generation by Combining Multiple Concepts on the Fly
Summary: Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University, and Adobe Research have created a novel method to personalize text-to-image diffusion models without extensive retraining, allowing users to quickly incorporate new concepts with just a few examples. The method, called Custom Diffusion, fine-tunes a small subset of model weights to capture new concepts while preserving existing knowledge. This approach is efficient, prevents catastrophic forgetting, and enables the combination of multiple concepts in novel settings. However, it has limitations, including difficulty with complex compositions and composing three or more concepts.
