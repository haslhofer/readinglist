## Andrew Ng Unveils New Retrieval for RAG Course to Enhance AI Systems' Precision and Contextual Understanding
Summary: Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, announced a new short course on advanced retrieval techniques for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models. By combining query expansion, reranking, and embedding adaptation, RAG systems become significantly more effective. This course, taught by Chroma founder Anton Troynikov, delves into the techniques used to construct and train embedding adaptors, thereby enhancing RAG systems.
