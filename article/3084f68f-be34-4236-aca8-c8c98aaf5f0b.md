## Using Embeddings and Clustering Techniques to Understand Image Data
Summary: This blog post introduces OpenAI CLIP embeddings and their usage in computer vision. Embeddings are an efficient way to represent images by capturing high-level visual and semantic information. Using CLIP embeddings, computer vision tasks such as image clustering, dataset analysis, and identifying similar images become more manageable. The blog also demonstrates how to apply embeddings to the MNIST dataset and provides insights into t-SNE and UMAP dimensionality reduction techniques. Additionally, it highlights the advantages of CLIP embeddings, including their efficiency and ability to preserve essential visual and semantic characteristics.
