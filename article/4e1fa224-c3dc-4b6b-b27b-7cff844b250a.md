## Hugging Face user demonstrates large language model running on powerful GPU to generate text.
Summary: Using a powerful DGX machine with 4 A100 GPUs (80GB), the author demonstrates the successful execution of Mixtral 8x22B, a large language model (LLM) from Hugging Face. With CPU offloading, the model can generate text using a concise code snippet and a provided text prompt. However, despite the author's claim of being "GPU poor," others suggest that such computational capabilities are still out of reach for many users, highlighting the ongoing trade-offs and accessibility challenges in the field of LLMs.
