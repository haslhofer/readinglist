## Mask2Former and OneFormer: Universal Image Segmentation with Transformers
Summary: Mask2Former and OneFormer are state-of-the-art neural networks for image segmentation. They are the first "universal image segmentation" models, capable of solving instance, semantic, and panoptic segmentation tasks with a unified architecture. Mask2Former achieves state-of-the-art results on all three tasks by improving the neural network architecture, while OneFormer further improves accuracy by conditioning the model on text input. Both models are available for easy use in the Hugging Face Transformers library.
