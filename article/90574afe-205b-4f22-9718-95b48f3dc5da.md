## Donut: Document Understanding Transformer (Donut) and Synthetic Document Generator (SynthDoG)
Summary: Donut is a new method of document understanding that uses an OCR-free end-to-end transformer model, which doesn't require off-the-shelf OCR engines/APIs. It shows state-of-the-art performance on tasks like document classification or information extraction. In addition, Donut presents SynthDoG, which helps the model pre-training to be flexible across various languages and domains.
