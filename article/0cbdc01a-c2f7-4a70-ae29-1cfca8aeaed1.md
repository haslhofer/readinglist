## Generative AI Allows Natural Language Queries to Data Lakes and Databases
Summary: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has facilitated communication with data lakes and databases using natural language. The demonstration showcases English-based queries to a data lake on Amazon S3, with production engineers seeking information like production levels or bottom-hole pressure. The underlying architecture involves SageMaker foundation models, real-time endpoints, and LangChain. A discussion panel delves into the potential to incorporate features like visualization creation and explores use cases where this AI-driven approach has been applied in industries like healthcare and retail.
