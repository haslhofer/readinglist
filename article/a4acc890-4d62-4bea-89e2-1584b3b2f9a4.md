## Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions
Summary: Self-Instruct presents a framework to enhance the instruction-following abilities of pretrained language models by utilizing their own generated instructions, input, and output samples. Instead of relying on limited and diverse human-written instruction data, our model bootstraps off its own generations, resulting in a 33% absolute improvement on Super-NaturalInstructions and outperforms InstructGPT-001 on a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks. Self-Instruct provides an efficient and effective method for aligning language models with instructions, and we make our synthetic dataset and code publicly available.
