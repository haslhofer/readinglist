## LLaMA vs GPT3.5 vs Bloom: Battle of Language Models for Accuracy, Speed, and Naturalness
Summary: Various Large Language Models (LLMs) were put to the test to gauge their performance in answering questions about a recent event. Open-source models like Flan-t5 performed well on straightforward questions but struggled with humor. Models with OpenRail License gave short answers with confusing usage restrictions. LLaMA provided decent explanations but relied heavily on quoting articles and couldn't generate jokes. Alpaca had jokes but struggled with answering questions. Private models like GPT3 and GPT4 excelled with detailed responses and humor but were expensive. Overall, LLMs show promise but vary in performance and may not be suitable for sensitive information.
