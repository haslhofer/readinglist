## Machine Learning: Challenges of deploying traditional ML and LLM applications
Summary: According to Chip Huyen, deploying traditional machine learning and large language model applications presents significant challenges.  These challenges include the ambiguity of natural languages, the stochastic nature of LLMs leading to inconsistency in user experience, and the rapid evolution of the field making it difficult to make informed business decisions.  To address these challenges, companies are exploring task composability, agents, and control flows.
