## Self-Instruct: A Framework for Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions
Summary: Self-Instruct is a framework that improves the instruction-following capabilities of pre-trained language models by generating instructions, inputs, and outputs from the model itself, and using these to fine-tune the model. This method achieves comparable performance to models trained with human-written instructions and private user data, and outperforms existing public instruction datasets.
