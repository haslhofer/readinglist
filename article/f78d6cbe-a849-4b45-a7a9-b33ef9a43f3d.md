## LLaMA and LangChain Models Run in Google Colab for Free
Summary: The author experimented with running the LLaMA-13B model and LangChain in Google Colab, demonstrating how to use a free Google Colab instance to run a LLaMA model and extract information using the FAISS database. They also tested some extra LangChain functionality like making chat-based applications and using agents. The code was opened in the web browser and run in the cloud, allowing anyone to access it without requiring a powerful PC.
