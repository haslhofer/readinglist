## Whisper JAX: Transcribe audio 70x faster with optimized implementation for both GPU and TPU
Summary: Hugging Face's Whisper JAX implementation offers 70x faster transcription speeds compared to the original OpenAI model. This speed gain is a result of batching, using JAX over PyTorch, and leveraging TPUs over GPUs. The model allows for transcribing an hour of audio in under 15 seconds. It supports all pre-trained OpenAI checkpoints, making it easy to adapt to various languages. Developers can access the repository to utilize the model and fine-tune it for their specific use cases. Additionally, it enables converting PyTorch weights to Flax for fine-tuned checkpoints.
