## RAGFlow: Open-Source RAG Engine for Deep Document Understanding and Truthful Q&A
Summary: RAGFlow is an open-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) engine that combines deep document understanding and large language models (LLMs) to provide question-answering capabilities. Key features include knowledge extraction from complex data formats, explainable chunking, grounded citations to reduce hallucinations, support for various data sources, and a streamlined RAG workflow. To start using RAGFlow, you need to meet specified hardware requirements, clone the repo, build Docker images, and set up LLM configurations. System configurations are managed in .env, service_conf.yaml, and docker-compose.yml files. RAGFlow welcomes contributions and has a roadmap for future development.
