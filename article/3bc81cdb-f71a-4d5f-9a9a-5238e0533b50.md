## Guidelines for Effective Questioning and Prompting of Large Language Models: 26 Guiding Principles
Summary: Researchers introduce 26 guiding principles to streamline the process of querying and prompting large language models. They aim to simplify formulating questions for various scales of language models, enabling enhanced user comprehension of their behaviors. The principles are tested on LLaMA-1/2 and GPT-3.5/4, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving instructions and prompt designs. This work provides a comprehensive guide for researchers exploring the prompting of large language models.
