## Stanford Researcher develops new prompting strategy for LLMs, achieving better performance with fewer parameters
Summary: A novel prompting strategy called "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) has been developed by a Stanford researcher to enhance the performance of open-source language models with fewer parameters, enabling them to rival and even surpass the performance of larger models like GPT3-175B in few-shot scenarios across various benchmarks. This approach involves identifying effective prompt properties, creating a two-step question-answering prompting pipeline, and aggregating multiple imperfect prompts using weak supervision, leading to improved prompting performance without fine-tuning.
