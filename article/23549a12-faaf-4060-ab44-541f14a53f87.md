## RAG Augments LLMs with Dynamic Knowledge Access for Accurate and Reliable Responses
Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a revolutionary approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT. It combines the parameterized knowledge of LLMs with dynamically accessible, non-parameterized external data, leading to more accurate, relevant, and up-to-date responses. RAG also reduces hallucinations, improves transparency through source citations, and allows for the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, making it highly adaptable and versatile across various applications.
