## FastChat: A platform for training, serving, and evaluating large language models
Summary: FastChat is an open platform for training, serving, and evaluating large language model based chatbots. It offers a distributed multi-model serving system with web UI and OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs. It has been applied to train and serve models like Vicuna and LongChat, and can also chat with FastChat-T5. It supports various hardware, including GPU, CPU, Metal Backend, Intel XPU, and Ascend NPU. The platform enables users to launch a controller, model workers, and a Gradio web server to serve models and interact with them. It provides OpenAI-compatible APIs and integrates with Hugging Face Generation APIs, LangChain, and MT-bench for automated evaluation. The training code is based on Stanford Alpaca with additional multi-turn conversation support. Fine-tuning instructions are provided, and the platform can be used to train other models and support LoRA. SkyPilot can be used for cost-effective cloud training. The platform is licensed under Apache-2.0 and has been used by over 350 projects and has 219 contributors.
