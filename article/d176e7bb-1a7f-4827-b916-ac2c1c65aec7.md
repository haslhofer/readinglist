## AutoTrain: Introducing the Easiest Way to Fine-Tune Language Models
Summary: A new user interface (UI) has been developed for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using Hugging Face Hub. Users can upload a CSV file, select parameters, and click a button to start fine-tuning. The trained models are saved as private repositories in the user's account. Pricing is based on per-minute usage during training.
