## Microsoft Researchers Introduce TaskMatrix.AI, Connecting Foundation Models with APIs for Task Completion
Summary: Microsoft researchers have developed TaskMatrix.AI, an AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with millions of APIs, enabling it to perform various digital and physical tasks. This system comprises a Multimodal Conversational Foundation Model for user communication, an API Platform for storing and accessing APIs, an API Selector for recommending relevant APIs, and an API Executor for executing API-based code. The team evaluated TaskMatrix.AI's performance in generating PowerPoint slides, demonstrating its understanding of user instructions and content, and its ability to break down tasks into API calls.
