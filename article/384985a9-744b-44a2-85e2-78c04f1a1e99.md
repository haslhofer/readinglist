Summary: MosaicML introduces its optimized MosaicBERT architecture, claiming that a competitive BERT-Base model can be pretraining from scratch on the Mosaic ML platform for only $20. The MosaicBERT architecture includes modifications to the attention mechanism and feedforward layers, resulting in improved performance and training efficiency. Benchmarking against Hugging Face's BERT-Base, MosaicBERT-Base reaches a similar average GLUE score in less time and at a lower cost. MosaicBERT also demonstrates promising results for larger models like BERT-Large, achieving an average GLUE score of 83.2 in 15.85 hours compared to 23.35 hours for Hugging Face's BERT-Large. These advancements enable researchers and engineers to pretrain custom BERT models on their own data without time and cost restrictions.
