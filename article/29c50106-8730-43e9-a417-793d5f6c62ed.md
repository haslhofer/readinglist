## RAG's evolution: Will Long Context LLMs Replace Retrieval-Augmented Generation?
Summary: Long context LLMs may not entirely replace RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology. While long context windows can alleviate limitations in reasoning and retrieval over multiple facts, RAG may evolve to incorporate full document indexing, long context embeddings, and a shift from a prompt-response paradigm to an iterative "flow" approach with post-retrieval reasoning and feedback. Experts suggest that RAG's advantages in cost-effectiveness and token usage make it a viable complement to long context LLMs, especially in situations where large amounts of data need to be indexed and analyzed.
