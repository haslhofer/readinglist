## Andrej Karpathy builds a transformer-based language model from scratch
Summary: The video is a comprehensive introduction to Generatively Pretrained Transformers (GPT), inspired by OpenAI's GPT-2 and GPT-3. Andrej Karpathy, the presenter, builds a GPT from scratch, exploring the connections to ChatGPT and demonstrating how GitHub Copilot, a GPT, can assist in writing code. The video provides a detailed overview of attention mechanisms and their role in language modeling. Karpathy delves into the mathematics of neural networks and backpropagation, offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying concepts. Viewers also gain insights into the architectures and training methodologies employed in building large language models like GPT.
