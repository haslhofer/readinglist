## Responsible Task Automation: Empowering Large Language Models as Accountable Assistants
Summary: The Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) framework empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) as responsible task automators by addressing feasibility, completeness, and security concerns. It employs prompt engineering to predict task feasibility and leverages learnable models or a local memory mechanism to verify executor completeness and enhance security. ResponsibleTA safeguards against potential risks as LLMs increasingly automate tasks, potentially improving the reliability and safety of human-machine collaboration.
