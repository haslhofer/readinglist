## ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin: Easily find your documents using natural language queries.
Summary: The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin is a flexible tool that enables users to semantically search and retrieve personal or organizational documents through the use of natural language. The plugin encompasses a range of directories, such as datastore, docs, examples, local_server, models, scripts, server, and services, providing detailed information on its setup, development, and deployment.

At the core of this plugin is a datastore that employs vector database providers to store and query document embeddings, allowing users to access the most relevant document segments. FastAPI serves as the plugin's primary server implementation, facilitating API endpoint exposure for upserting, querying, and deleting documents. To enhance search results, users can refine them using metadata filters based on source, date, author, or other criteria.

An intriguing feature of the plugin is its memory capacity, which enables it to save snippets from conversations into the vector database, thereby contributing to a more context-aware chat experience. Crucially, this plugin prioritizes data authorization and privacy, ensuring that users only add authorized content and that it remains confidential. Furthermore, it provides a variety of authentication methods to secure the plugin.

The plugin's design centers around the OpenAPI schema and manifest, which define essential metadata. For those seeking personalization options, the plugin allows for customization of the logo, data models, and plugin name, description, and usage instructions. Developers can select from four authentication methods: no authentication, HTTP Bearer, OAuth, or service level HTTP. Once the plugin is ready for deployment, it can be hosted on platforms supporting Docker containers like Fly.io, Heroku, Render, or Azure Container Apps.

To keep the vector database up-to-date, incoming webhooks can be configured to the plugin's API. The scripts directory contains tools for batch upserting or processing text documents from various data sources. These scripts can screen documents for PII (personally identifiable information) and extract metadata using language models.

The plugin supports various vector database providers, including Pinecone, Weaviate, Zilliz, Milvus, Qdrant, Redis, LlamaIndex, Chroma, Azure Cognitive Search, Azure CosmosDB Mongo vCore, Supabase, Postgres, and Elasticsearch. Each provider requires specific environment variables and setup instructions.

The plugin actively encourages contributions from the community to improve its capabilities and features. Those interested in contributing can follow the PR checklist to ensure a smooth review and merge process. As the plugin continues to evolve, potential future directions include integrating more vector database providers, expanding optional services, and refining chunking strategies and embeddings calculations.

Overall, the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin serves as a powerful tool for users seeking efficient and context-aware retrieval of personal or organizational documents through natural language queries.
