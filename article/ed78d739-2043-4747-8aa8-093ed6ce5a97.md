## Text-to-Video Model Generates Videos From English Text Descriptions
Summary: Hugging Face offers a text-to-video generation model trained on a multi-stage diffusion process. Users can input a textual description, and the model generates a corresponding video. Suitable for research purposes, the model has limitations and biases related to its English-only support and the quality of generated text and complex compositions. The model's capabilities do not extend to realistic human or event representation, and it cannot create clear text. Training data includes publicly available sources like LAION5B and ImageNet, and pre-training involves filtering for aesthetic, watermark, and duplicate content.
