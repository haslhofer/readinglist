## Advanced Retrieval with Additional Context and MetaData using LlamaIndex
Summary: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) augments LLM knowledge through additional, often private or real-time, data. It entails indexing data, splitting it into smaller chunks, querying the indexed data using LLMs to retrieve relevant context, and generating responses. Advanced RAG techniques include parent-child chunks retrieval, metadata references, and storing indexed data. This enables smaller chunks to be retrieved during retrieval but incorporating the surrounding context for LLM reasoning. One can implement such techniques using open-source LLM and embedding models. Evaluations can be performed to compare the effectiveness of different strategies. Additional references are provided for further exploration.
