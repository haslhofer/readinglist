## AI-based 'Grounding Dino' infers human poses from text descriptions
Summary: Eduardo Pacheco's script, "Grounding Dino Inference," explores the use of grounded inference in dinosaur research. It demonstrates how linking textual knowledge about dinosaurs with visual and spatial data can enhance our understanding of their behavior and habitats. The script highlights the potential of multimodal deep embedding models for combining visual and textual information, enabling more accurate and comprehensive inferences in paleontological studies.
