## Adapter Layers: A Parameter-Efficient Way to Fine-Tune Large Language Models
Summary: Finetuning large language models such as BERT, GPT-3, and LLaMA can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this, researchers have developed parameter-efficient finetuning methods, including adapters. Adapters involve adding tunable layers to the transformer blocks of an LLM, allowing for efficient fine-tuning while maintaining comparable performance to traditional fine-tuning approaches. This method has been successfully applied to improve the predictive performance of LLMs on tasks such as sentiment classification.
