## Embeddings in Computer Vision: Clustering MNIST, Visualizing High-Dimensional Data, and Identifying Image Similarity with OpenAI CLIP
Summary: This blog post explores the use of embeddings in computer vision, particularly OpenAI CLIP embeddings, which are used to understand high-dimensional data, analyze dataset class distribution, identify similar images, and assess dataset quality. The post also demonstrates how to use embeddings to cluster MNIST images based on pixel brightness and provides a Google Colab notebook for experimenting with these concepts in real-time. Additionally, it highlights the advantages of CLIP embeddings, such as their ability to effectively encode high-level visual and semantic information, making them suitable for working with complex real-world photographs.
