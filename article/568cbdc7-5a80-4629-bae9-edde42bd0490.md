## Architecting the Edge for AI and ML: Understanding Trends, Elements, and Design Patterns
Summary: The article delves into the intersection of edge computing and machine learning (ML) and how the proliferation of powerful single-board computers (SBCs) and the advent of 5G networks have created fertile ground for edge ML. Edge devices offer unique opportunities but also pose challenges due to their varying power consumption and network connectivity. The author stresses the need for an architecture that can adapt to these conditions, and proposes a framework that focuses on location-centric deployment and management of ML models. The architecture's key components are a central management hub, device agnostic support, low-latency inference, and the ability to operate in disconnected environments. Additionally, it introduces four design patterns for edge ML architectures: native edge, network local, edge cloud, and remote batch, each suitable for specific use cases and workloads. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions in the emerging realm of edge ML.
