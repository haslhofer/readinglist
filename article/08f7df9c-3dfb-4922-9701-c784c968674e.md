## AWS data lakes can be queried using natural language with generative AI
Summary: Felipe Lopez, a Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services (AWS), shares a demo showcasing the integration of generative AI with data lakes and databases, allowing users to query and interact with data using natural language. This architecture utilizes SageMaker foundation models, real-time endpoints, and LangChain to enable natural language-based queries on a production data lake hosted on S3. The demo highlights the potential of this integration for production engineers to ask specific questions about production data and receive instant answers. This technology opens up the possibility of building chatbots or virtual assistants to enhance the data exploration experience.
