## TextReducer: A Tool for Summarization and Information Extraction
Summary: TextReducer is a revolutionary tool for summarization and information extraction, powered by SentenceTransformer. Unlike traditional extractive summaries, TextReducer revolves around a specific target, focusing on user-specified information while ignoring the rest. Remarkably, it preserves grammatical features like coreference by carving away unnecessary sentences, resulting in fluent summarizations. The class offers methods for targeted reduction, summarization, PDF reduction, and is easily installable via pip. Its applications encompass summarization, information extraction, question answering, and GPT3/ChatGPT prompting. With its lightweight, coherent, and powerful features, TextReducer excels in handling large texts, making it an invaluable asset for various tasks.
