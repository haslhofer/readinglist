## ChatGPT-powered website chatbot allows users to have conversations with websites
Summary: A new version of Aista Magic Cloud has been released. It enables users to copy and paste a JavaScript tag into their existing website to interact with ChatGPT and AI conversationally. Fine-tuning the model is done automatically by crawling and scraping the website to generate a custom machine-learning AI capable of answering relevant questions. Accuracy improves over time as the module logs questions/answers and allows reinforcement of training data.
