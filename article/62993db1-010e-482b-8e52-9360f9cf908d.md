## Video to Document: Chatting with ChatGPT over Videos
Summary: VLog is a project that allows users to convert long videos into documents containing both visual and audio information. This document can then be sent to ChatGPT, enabling users to have conversations about the video. The project utilizes various tools such as ChatGPT for language reasoning, BLIP2 and GRIT for vision captioning, Whisper for multilingual ASR translation, and KTS for video segmentation. The generated video document is saved in a log file. Users can also run the project in Gradio, a platform for creating and sharing interactive machine learning applications. The project acknowledges the contributions of various open-source projects and invites users to provide suggestions and feedback.
