## Deploying FLAN-T5 XXL on Amazon SageMaker for Real-Time Inference using Transformers
Summary: This guide provides a step-by-step process to deploy FLAN-T5-XXL, a large language model from Google, on Amazon SageMaker for real-time inference using Hugging Face's Inference Deep Learning Container. It begins by creating a custom inference script and requirements for efficient model loading. Then, it explains how to create a SageMaker model artifact by combining the inference script and model weights into a model.tar.gz archive. Next, it covers uploading the model artifact to Amazon S3 and deploying the model to Amazon SageMaker using the HuggingFaceModel class. Finally, it demonstrates how to use the deployed model for inference with customizable parameters and provides examples of text summarization and question answering. The guide also includes instructions for deleting the model and endpoint once you've finished using them.
