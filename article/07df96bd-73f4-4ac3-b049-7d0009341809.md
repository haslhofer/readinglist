## BAAI releases Emu2, the largest generative multimodal model achieving new state-of-the-art performance
Summary: Emu is a series of generative multimodal models developed by BAAI Vision Team. It consists of two models, Emu1 and Emu2, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Emu1 is designed for generative pretraining in multimodality, while Emu2 is known for its in-context learning capabilities. Both models have open-source code, models, and inference code available, encouraging collaboration and fostering the growth of the multimodal intelligence community.
