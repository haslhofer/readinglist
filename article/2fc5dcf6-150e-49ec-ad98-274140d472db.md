## Togethercomputer's GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16: A Fine-Tuned Language Model for Engaging Conversations
Summary: Here's a summary of the provided text: GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 is a 20-billion-parameter open-source chat model developed by Together Computer, fine-tuned from EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX with over 40 million instructions and over 100% carbon-negative compute. The model excels at tasks like summarization, question-answering, extraction, and classification, but it has limitations such as knowledge-based closed question and answering, coding tasks, repetition, context switching, and creative writing. It is intended for research purposes, including safe deployment of models, probing and understanding limitations and biases, and generation of artworks. Misuse, malicious use, and out-of-scope use are prohibited, and the model has limitations in accuracy and relevance for complex or ambiguous questions.
