## ChatGPT, the AI Chatbot, Earns B-Grade on Wharton MBA Final Exam, Raises Concerns About the Future of Education
Summary: ChatGPT, an advanced AI chatbot, has raised concerns among educators about its potential impact on academic integrity and the value of MBA programs. A Wharton School of Business professor conducted a study where ChatGPT received a B to B- grade on a final exam in an MBA core course, demonstrating its capabilities in basic operations management and process analysis tasks. Experts believe that ChatGPTâ€™s abilities will continue to improve with support from Microsoft and competition from Google's AI tools. The automation of skills taught in MBA programs through AI tools like ChatGPT could potentially reduce the value of an MBA education, similar to the impact calculators had on jobs requiring manual mathematical operations. Educators and business leaders need to address the implications and adapt to the increasing use of AI in education and the workplace.
