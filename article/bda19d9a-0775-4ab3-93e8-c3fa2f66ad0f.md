## Parakeet RNNT 1.1B: A High-Accuracy Speech Recognition Model for English
Summary: Parakeet RNNT 1.1B is an English ASR model developed by NVIDIA NeMo and Suno.ai teams. It utilizes the FastConformer with RNNT loss trained on 64K hours of data, achieving strong speech recognition accuracy. The model is available in the NeMo toolkit for inference and fine-tuning, supporting transcription of audio samples to lower case English alphabet. It was trained using NVIDIA NeMo and can be deployed on NVIDIA Riva for real-time speech recognition.
