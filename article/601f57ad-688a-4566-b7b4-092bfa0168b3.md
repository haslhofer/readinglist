## Transformers: Unraveling the Architecture and Applications of this Game-Changing Neural Network Model
Summary: Transformers are neural network architectures that comprehend context by tracking correlations in sequential data, enabling the conversion of input sequences into output sequences. They excel in natural language processing and computer vision due to their efficient parallelization capability. Prominent transformer models include BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT-3, which have facilitated text generation, code generation, and image and audio generation.
