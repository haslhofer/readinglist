## Together Unveils OpenChatKit: An Open-Source Chatbot Toolkit with Fine-Tuning Capabilities and Community Feedback Integration
Summary: Together, LAION, and Ontocord created OpenChatKit, an open-source chatbot framework that provides researchers and developers with tools to build specialized chatbots for various applications. The kit includes a fine-tuned large language model, customization recipes for fine-tuning, an extensible retrieval system for incorporating real-time information, and a moderation model to filter inappropriate content. OpenChatKit is built on EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX and GPT-J models and trained on a dataset created by LAION and Ontocord. Users can contribute feedback, datasets, and improvements to the project through a Hugging Face app and a GitHub repository. The Together platform, which combines data, models, and computation, was used to train the models and offers a green zone of 100% carbon negative compute resources.
