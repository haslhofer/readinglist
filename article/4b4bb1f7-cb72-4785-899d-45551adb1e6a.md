## Researchers develop a new programming language, LMQL, to enhance interaction with large language models like ChatGPT.
Summary: Researchers from ETH Zurich created a new open-source platform and programming language called LMQL, which enables users to interact with large language models like ChatGPT more easily, cheaply, and safely. This programming language combines the power of natural and programming languages, allowing users to control the model's behavior and prevent unwanted outputs. Additionally, it is accessible to users with various skill levels, including those with less experience in coding.
