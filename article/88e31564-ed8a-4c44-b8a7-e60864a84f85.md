## Train a ControlNet model with Diffusers to control Stable Diffusion using extra conditions
Summary: ControlNet is a neural network structure that allows fine-grained control of diffusion models by adding extra conditions. The training process requires planning the condition, building a dataset, and training the model. Users can train their own ControlNet for Stable Diffusion by following a step-by-step guide. Hugging Face provides the necessary resources, including code and training scripts, to train ControlNets on GPUs with different VRAM sizes. The trained model can be used to control the generation of images by Stable Diffusion based on the specified conditions.
