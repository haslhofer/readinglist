## Build an image similarity system with Hugging Face Datasets and Transformers
Summary: Hugging Face's image similarity system allows users to find similar images to a query image using embeddings, cosine similarity, and hash tables. The system leverages the Transformers library to load a vision model and processor for extracting image embeddings. These embeddings are compared to the embedding of the query image to determine the similarity scores. The top-k similar images are then retrieved and displayed. The system can be extended to handle larger datasets by reducing the dimensionality of the embeddings or using FAISS for efficient similarity search.
