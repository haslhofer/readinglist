## MAV3D: Generating Dynamic 3D Scenes from Text Descriptions
Summary: MAV3D, a method for generating three-dimensional dynamic scenes from text descriptions, is presented. It uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The generated dynamic video can be viewed from any camera location and angle and composited into any 3D environment. Trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos, MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data. Comprehensive experiments show its effectiveness, making it the first method to generate 3D dynamic scenes from text descriptions.
