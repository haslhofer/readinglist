## Auto-encoder: Understanding Its Components and Use Cases
Summary: An autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network that efficiently compresses and encodes data, then reconstructs it to be as close to the original input as possible. Its main components include an encoder that reduces data dimensions, a bottleneck layer containing the compressed representation, a decoder that reconstructs the data, and a reconstruction loss function. Autoencoders have various applications, including data denoising, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, anomaly detection, and image generation.
