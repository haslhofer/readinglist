## ControlNet training and inference with the StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline
Summary: ControlNet, a framework that allows for supporting various spatial contexts as additional conditionings to Diffusion models, has been integrated into Diffusers. The StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline exposes the controlnet argument to provide a trained ControlNetModel instance while keeping the pre-trained diffusion model weights the same. It supports conditioning with depth maps, segmentation maps, scribbles, keypoints, Canny edges, Openpose poses, and more. Combinations of multiple conditionings are also possible, with the flexibility to mask conditionings and vary conditioning scales. The pipeline leverages a fast scheduler, smart model offloading, and Xformers attention layer acceleration for efficient and memory-friendly inference. Combining these techniques results in faster generation times and lower VRAM consumption compared to the original ControlNet implementation. Examples and a Colab notebook are provided to explore the pipeline and showcase its capabilities.
