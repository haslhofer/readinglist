## Transformers: Neural Network Architectures for Understanding Contextual Relationships in Sequential Data
Summary: Transformers are neural network architectures designed to understand the context by tracking relationships in sequential data, like text or speech. They address the issue of sequence transduction, transforming input sequences into output sequences, and have applications in natural language processing and computer vision. Transformers consist of multiple encoder and decoder layers, enabling parallelization and efficient training on large datasets. The attention mechanism allows them to focus on relevant parts of the input data, resulting in improved accuracy and performance in various tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and image captioning.
