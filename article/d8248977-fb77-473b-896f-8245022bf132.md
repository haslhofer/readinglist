## Microsoft Unveils TaskMatrix.AI - An AI Ecosystem Linking Foundation Models with APIs for Task Completion
Summary: Microsoft researchers introduced TaskMatrix.AI, a new AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with millions of APIs to enable them to perform various digital and physical tasks. It comprises a multimodal conversational foundation model for user communication, an API platform with a unified schema and documentation, an API selector for recommending relevant APIs, and an API executor to execute task-solving logic. The system can be trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback to optimize performance. Experiments demonstrated TaskMatrix.AI's ability to generate PowerPoint slides based on user instructions, highlighting its potential to improve task performance by integrating existing APIs.
