## Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps): Managing the Lifecycle of AI Products Powered by LLMs
Summary: LLMOps is a new term in the AI industry that stands for Large Language Model Operations, which is practically analogous to MLOps but specifically for LLMs. The increased attention to LLMs is due to the recent popularity of ChatGPT, which has led to numerous applications such as writing assistants and programming aids. LLMOps involves selecting a foundation model, adapting it to downstream tasks through prompt engineering and fine-tuning, evaluating its performance, and deploying and monitoring the model. LLMOps differs from MLOps in terms of data management, experimentation, evaluation, cost, and latency. Currently, the focus is on adapting pre-trained LLMs and addressing issues such as cost and latency. The future of LLMOps involves the development of new tools and best practices as LLMs become more prevalent in AI-powered products.
