## Anthropic Tool Calling Added to Claude 3 APIs, Enhancing Structured Outputs
Summary: Anthropic has added tool use capabilities to their Claude 3 APIs through the langchain-anthropic package. This feature allows for structured outputs and improves validation and parsing of complex responses. Developers can design fallbacks to handle errors in structured output processing, and the integration enhances the capabilities of LangChain's platform for building LLM applications.
