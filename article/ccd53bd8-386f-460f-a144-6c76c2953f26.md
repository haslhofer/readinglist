## Text-To-4D: Generating Dynamic 3D Scenes from Text Descriptions
Summary: MAV3D is a pioneering method for creating dynamic 3D scenes from text descriptions. It utilizes a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency using a Text-to-Video diffusion-based model. The resulting dynamic video output can be viewed from various angles and composited into 3D environments. MAV3D requires no 3D or 4D data and trains solely on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MAV3D, establishing it as the first method capable of generating dynamic 3D scenes from text descriptions.
