Summary: TII has released Falcon, a new open-source Large Language Model (LLM) with two versions: 7B trained on 1.5 trillion tokens and 40B trained on 1 trillion tokens. Falcon outperforms comparable open-source models thanks to its training on refined web data, uses FlashAttention and multi-query Attention, has a 2048 context window, comes with a license allowing commercial use, and was trained on Amazon SageMaker. The 40B model is multilingual, including German, Spanish, and French. The models are available on Hugging Face.
