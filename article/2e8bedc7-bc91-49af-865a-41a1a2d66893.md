## Stanford Researcher Develops Simple Prompting Strategy Enabling Open-source LLMs with 30x Fewer Parameters to Exceed Few-shot Performance of GPT3-175B
Summary: A new simple prompting strategy called Ask Me Anything (AMA) was developed by a Stanford researcher to enhance the performance of open-source language models (LLMs) with fewer parameters. By combining multiple imperfect prompts with weak supervision, AMA enables smaller models like GPT-J-6B to achieve and even surpass the performance of the much larger GPT3-175B model on various benchmarks, demonstrating the potential for personal-private machine learning applications.
