## Multimodal Universal Information Extraction: Recognizing Everything from All Modalities at Once
Summary: The concept of Grounded Multimodal Universal Information Extraction (MUIE) is introduced, offering a unified framework for analyzing information extraction tasks across diverse modalities by recognizing and grounding information within their corresponding context. A tailored multimodal large language model, Reamo, is developed to effectively extract and ground information from all modalities simultaneously. A new test set is constructed for grounded MUIE, facilitating extensive evaluation of Reamo. Comparisons with pipeline-integrated MLLMs demonstrate Reamo's superiority across evaluation dimensions, setting a benchmark for future research.
