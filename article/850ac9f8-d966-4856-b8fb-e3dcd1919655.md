## Large language models like ChatGPT are blurry JPEGs of the Internet
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are similar to lossy compression algorithms, which offer paraphrases rather than quotes like search engines. This analogy helps understand both ChatGPT's strengths and weaknesses. Their blurriness makes them seem smarter than lossless algorithms, but they're prone to hallucinations and can't handle addition and subtraction well. GPT-3's output is acceptable only when it doesn't produce exact quotes, creating the illusion of understanding. LLMs can be used as blurry jpegs of the web, but using them for search or content generation may not be beneficial. They might be useful as a starting point for original writing, but the process of writing itself is valuable for developing skills and discovering ideas. LLMs may be able to write good prose in the future but are not there yet.
