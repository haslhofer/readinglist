## LlamaIndex Releases New Best Retrieval Algorithm Inspired by ChatGPT
Summary: LlamaIndex released AutoMergingRetriever, a retrieval algorithm inspired by ChatGPT. It divides a document into chunks, further dividing "parent" chunks into "child" chunks. Queries are initiated by retrieving smaller chunks based on embedding similarity. This approach aids language models in generating improved outcomes by retrieving cohesive and extensive contextual sections flexibly and avoiding overloading with excessive context.
