## PowerInfer: A GPU-CPU Hybrid Inference Engine for Deploying Large Language Models Locally
Summary: In this post, Elvis S. showcases PowerInfer, a high-speed inference engine for deploying LLMs locally. This engine combines GPU and CPU resources to significantly reduce GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfer, achieving impressive token generation rates. It outperforms other inference methods like "llama.cpp" and achieves results close to a top-tier server-grade GPU. PowerInfer enables the use of LLMs like Llama 2, Faclon 40B, and Mistral-7B for local applications.
