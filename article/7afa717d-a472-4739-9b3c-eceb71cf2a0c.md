Summary: This survey provides an overview of the recent advances in large language models (LLMs), a rapidly evolving field in natural language processing. LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in solving various NLP tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvement and unique abilities not seen in smaller-scale language models. The paper covers four major aspects of LLMs: pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. It also discusses the available resources for developing LLMs, identifies remaining issues, and explores potential future directions.
