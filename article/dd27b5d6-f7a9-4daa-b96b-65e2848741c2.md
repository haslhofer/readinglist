## Prompt Engineering: Unveiling the Art of Prompting Large Language Models for Efficient Problem-Solving
Summary: Prompt engineering, harnessing the power of LLMs (Large Language Models), has gained attention in the field of machine learning. By crafting effective prompts, we can mold these models to solve specific problems. Prompt engineering involves techniques such as zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain of thoughts, and self-consistency. It enables LLMs to access tools and databases, extract information, and perform complex tasks. These models can be viewed as flexible subroutines, where prompts serve as molds that shape their behavior.
