## Open-source NSQL model outperforms ChatGPT and GPT-4 in text-to-SQL tasks
Summary: NSQL, a series of text-to-SQL models, outperforms ChatGPT and GPT4 in several metrics at small model sizes. It's based on Codegen from Salesforce, pre-trained on SQL queries, and further tuned on text/SQL pairs. Available in 350m, 2b, and 6b checkpoints, it has a bsd-3 open-source license, making it fully commercially usable. This could provide enterprises a cost-effective way to integrate text-to-SQL functionality into their data applications.
