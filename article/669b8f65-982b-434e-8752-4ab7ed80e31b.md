## LLM as a Chatbot Service
Summary: This repository provides a framework for utilizing various instruction-following fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) as a Chatbot service. It integrates the Ping Pong library for model-agnostic conversation and context management with the GradioChat UI, offering a user interface similar to HuggingChat. The code allows users to run the Gradio application or a Discord bot using supported models from the model zoo. It includes instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and leveraging internet search capabilities. The repository also contains information about supported Discord bot commands, context management strategies, and a list of currently supported models.
