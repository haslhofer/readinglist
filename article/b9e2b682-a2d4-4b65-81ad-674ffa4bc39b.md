## Tesla abandons plans for $25,000 electric car, focuses on robotaxi platform
Summary: Tesla has reportedly abandoned plans for its $25,000 "Model 2" electric vehicle, shifting its focus to a new robotaxi platform. Despite Elon Musk's long-standing promise of an affordable EV, the company has prioritized its next-generation vehicle platform and the development of a fully autonomous robotaxi, believing that the latter would make a low-cost vehicle obsolete. Tesla's strategic shift comes amid increasing competition from Chinese automakers and its loss of the top global EV producer title to BYD.
