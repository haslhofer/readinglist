## LLaMA 2: The Definitive Resource Guide
Summary: LLaMA 2, a large language model developed by Meta, is now available free for research and commercial use. It is the successor to LLaMA 1, with improved features such as training on 2 trillion tokens, double the context length, and the availability of fine-tuned models trained on human annotations. LLaMA 2 comes in three sizes - 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters - and can be accessed through various platforms such as AWS, Hugging Face, and Perplexity. The blog post provides links to resources for understanding the model's capabilities, testing it through playgrounds, learning about the research behind it, evaluating its performance, prompting it effectively, fine-tuning it using techniques like PEFT, and deploying it for inference.
