## New Method Introduces Synthetic Data and LLMs to Obtain High-Quality Text Embeddings
Summary: The paper presents a new method for obtaining high-quality text embeddings using synthetic data generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on manually collected labeled datasets. Fine-tuning open-source decoder-only LLMs on the synthetic data using contrastive loss achieves strong performance on text embedding benchmarks. Adding a small amount of labeled data further improves performance, setting new state-of-the-art results.
