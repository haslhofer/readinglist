## Together Releases OpenChatKit: An Open-Source Foundation for AI Chatbots
Summary: Together presents OpenChatKit, an open-source initiative that seeks to establish a solid foundation for developing specialized and general-purpose chatbots for various applications. The kit comprises four key components: an instruction-tuned large language model, customization recipes for fine-tuning the model, an extensible retrieval system for augmenting responses with live-updating information, and a moderation model for filtering inappropriate content. OpenChatKit enables community contributions and feedback to improve the training data and refining the models. It demonstrates impressive capabilities in natural language tasks but also acknowledges areas for improvement, such as knowledge-based question answering, coding tasks, repetition, context switching, and creative writing. The initiative highlights the potential of decentralized compute for building foundation models and emphasizes Together's commitment to sustainability with carbon-negative compute resources.
