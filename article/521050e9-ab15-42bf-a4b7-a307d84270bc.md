## Strategies for Summarizing Text with Large Language Models (LLMs)
Summary: To summarize text with a Large Language Model (LLM), there are several strategies available. One strategy involves fitting the entire text within the context window and obtaining the result directly. If the text exceeds the LLM's capacity, it can be broken down into chunks, summarized individually, and then combined into a final summary. Another strategy, known as "Refine," starts with the first chunk and refines it progressively with each subsequent chunk. These strategies aim to minimize information loss during summarization while accommodating lengthy text.
