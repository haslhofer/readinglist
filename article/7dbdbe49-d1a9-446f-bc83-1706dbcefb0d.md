## New open-source platform simplifies interaction with large language models like ChatGPT
Summary: Researchers from ETH Zurich developed a new programming language and open-source platform called LMQL (Language Model Query Language). LMQL enables easier, cheaper, and safer interactions with large language models like ChatGPT by combining natural and programming languages. It addresses issues such as unexpected outputs, lack of control, and transparency, allowing users to express safety constraints and guide the model's behavior. LMQL is accessible to users with varying expertise levels and serves as a valuable tool for researchers and technical programmers. The language is gaining interest within an interdisciplinary community, and the researchers plan long-term developments and presentations at international conferences.
