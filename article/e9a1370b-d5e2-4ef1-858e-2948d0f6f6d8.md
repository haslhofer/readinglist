Summary: Databricks has released Dolly 2.0, an open-source, instruction-following large language model (LLM) that is fine-tuned on a human-generated instruction dataset licensed for research and commercial use. Dolly 2.0 is based on the EleutherAI pythia model family and is trained on a new, high-quality human-generated instruction following dataset created by Databricks employees.
