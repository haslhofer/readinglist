## Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation System from Scratch Using LlamaIndex
Summary: LlamaIndex, a platform for building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, introduces a new initiative to teach AI engineers how to create RAG systems from scratch. The program consists of low-level tutorials covering data ingestion, retrieval, response synthesis, advanced retrieval algorithms, and agent loops. Additionally, LlamaIndex showcases its MultiDocAutoRetrieverPack, a RAG template that indexes documents with metadata dictionaries, enabling structured retrieval over metadata properties. Lastly, they offer insights into running open-source models through LlamaIndex integrations and demonstrate how to implement hybrid search from scratch.
