## Text2Poster: Automatically Laying Out Stylized Texts on Retrieved Images
Summary: The code is related to the paper "Text2Poster: Laying Out Stylized Texts on Retrieved Images" presented at ICASSP 2022. It offers an API to quickly generate posters by combining user-input text and background images retrieved using a BriVL text-image retrieval model. The project also includes a source code for those without access to mainland China resources, allowing them to retrieve background images locally. Users can install dependent libraries using anaconda or manually, download necessary weights and resources, and run the code with specified parameters. Intermediate processing files are generated during the process, and users can cite the paper if they find it useful.
