## Train Your Own ControlNet with Diffusers
Summary: To train a ControlNet model, one needs to plan the condition, build a dataset, and train the model. Planning the condition involves deciding what kind of conditioning to use and whether an existing model can convert regular images into the desired condition. Building the dataset requires collecting ground truth images, conditioning images, and captions. Training the model can be done using the diffusers training script, and the optimal training settings depend on the available GPU VRAM.
