## In 2022, Google Research made strides in language models, computer vision, multimodal models, and generative models. Language models can now generate coherent, contextual, natural-sounding responses and can be used for a wide range of tasks. Computer vision models have improved in terms of accuracy and can now perform complex tasks such as multi-step reasoning and solve mathematical and scientific problems. Multimodal models can flexibly handle many different modalities simultaneously and combine language with other modalities for new applications like video question answering and multitask visual grounding. Generative models have shown stunning advances in image generation, with models like Imagen and Parti generating high-resolution, photorealistic images from text prompts.
