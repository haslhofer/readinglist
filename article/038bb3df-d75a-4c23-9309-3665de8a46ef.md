## LangChain: Visualizing Data from CSV Files with Streamlit and LLMs
Summary: Langchain is a Python module that makes it easier to use large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate its capabilities, this article details how to analyze and visualize data stored in CSV files. The process involves setting up the agent, creating a user interface with Streamlit, and prompting the LLM with queries about the data. As an example, the user can ask the system to generate tables, graphs, or provide answers to questions about the data in the CSV file. The article includes code snippets for implementing the agent, setting up the user interface, and querying the agent. It also addresses potential issues such as API token limitations and provides alternatives for loading data from URLs or using an Azure OpenAI API key. Furthermore, the article includes a GitHub link where readers can access the complete code for the project.
