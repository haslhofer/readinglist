## How Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning Drive ChatGPT's Success
Summary: ChatGPT is an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) developed using machine learning Natural Language Processing models. It is trained on a vast dataset of text data, enabling it to understand and respond to text-based inputs in a comprehensive and coherent manner. The underlying methodology of ChatGPT includes the self-attention mechanism, which allows it to consider the relationships between different parts of text simultaneously. Additionally, it employs a novel technique called Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback, which helps ChatGPT learn and improve its responses based on feedback from human trainers.
