## Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools
Summary: Toolformer, a language model trained to utilize external tools via APIs, was developed. It learns to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to provide, and how to incorporate the results into future token prediction. With minimal demonstrations, it incorporates a variety of tools including a calculator, Q&A system, and search engines. Toolformer exhibits improved zero-shot performance across various downstream tasks, achieving competitiveness with larger models without compromising its core language modeling capabilities.
