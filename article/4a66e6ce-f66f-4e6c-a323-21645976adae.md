## Tesla's Occupancy-Net rival emerges from Beijing: TPV uses tri-perspective views for autonomous driving perception
Summary: Researchers have introduced TPV (Tri-Perspective View), an open-source vision-centric autonomous driving approach. TPV leverages a novel tri-perspective view representation and transformer-based encoder to outperform Tesla's Occupancy-Net method with a smaller training data and hour. It offers comparable performance to LiDAR methods and can accurately predict the semantic occupancy of all voxels in a scene. The paper, code, and project are available online.
