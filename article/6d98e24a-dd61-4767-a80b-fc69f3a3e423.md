## Hugging Face releases 5x faster Whisper fine-tuning with almost no degradation in WER
Summary: Hugging Face has made Whisper, an open-source automatic speech recognition model, five times faster to fine-tune with slight degradation in WER. This enables larger batch sizes and fitting the Whisper-large checkpoint in less than 8GB of VRAM. The improvement is driven by LoRA and the Hugging Face's PEFT.
