## Atomic Git Commits: A Simple Method to Dramatically Boost Your Productivity
Summary: In software development, an atomic commit is a commit that contains a single, irreducible unit of change. This means that each commit should be focused on a single, well-defined change, such as adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or refactoring code. Atomic commits have several advantages. They make it easier to revert changes, keep a clean git history, and review pull requests. Additionally, using atomic commits can help developers to be more productive and organized in their work, as it forces them to simplify complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.
