Understanding the Intuition and Methodology Behind the Popular Chat Bot ChatGPT
Summary: ChatGPT is a type of Large Language Model (LLM), a machine learning model that can understand and generate human language. It was created by Google and is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. ChatGPT uses a technique called "self-attention" to learn the relationships between words and phrases, allowing it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. Additionally, it has been trained using Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF), a technique that involves humans providing feedback on the model's output, helping it to learn what kind of responses are most appropriate.
