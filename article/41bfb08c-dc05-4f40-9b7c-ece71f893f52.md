## The foundation model stack presents opportunities for application developers, infrastructure builders, and tool creators alike.
Summary: The emergence of foundation models has led to the proliferation of generative AI applications and a new application platform. However, the current technical challenges limit the accessibility and defensibility of applications built on foundation models. The broader technical stack reveals opportunities for founders to build novel applications, find differentiation, and develop tooling. The focus is on developer frameworks, data sources and actions, and evaluation. Additionally, there are opportunities in training optimization, deployment, and inference efficiency. The field is constrained by the pace and quality of innovation and the ethical considerations surrounding FM use cases. The goal is to accelerate the development of AI-driven applications and unleash the potential of foundation models.
