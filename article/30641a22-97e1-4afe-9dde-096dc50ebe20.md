## Research Proposes Framework for Credit Scoring Using Synthetic Data to Preserve Borrowers' Privacy
Summary: Researchers introduce a novel framework to evaluate the performance of credit scoring models trained on synthetically generated data when applied to real-world datasets. Utilizing state-of-the-art synthetic data generators, they demonstrate that models can perform well on synthetic data but with a loss in predictive power when applied to real-world scenarios. The study also highlights the effectiveness of TVAE in synthesizing both continuous and categorical features and the impact of feature selection on the model's performance.
