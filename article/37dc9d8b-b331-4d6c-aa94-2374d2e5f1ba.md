## Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson emphasizes the importance of actions over arguments in persuasion and earning credibility.
Summary: David Heinemeier Hansson emphasizes the importance of actions over arguments in persuasion. He argues that people with strong convictions are unlikely to change their minds through arguments alone, and that only actions can unlock their minds. He believes credibility is earned through successful actions, which require taking risks and facing the possibility of being wrong. He encourages us to focus on doing rather than arguing, as the lessons derived from real-world experiences are more valuable than mere opinions.
