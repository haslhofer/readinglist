## LLMTools: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models on One Consumer GPU in Under 4 Bits
Summary: LLMTools is a user-friendly library designed for running and finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource settings. It allows users to quantize, infer, and finetune LLMs using a simple Python API. With LLMTools, one can finetune 3-bit LLMs for the first time using the LP-LoRA algorithm, which is a memory-efficient finetuning method that integrates with modular quantization modules. This makes it possible to finetune quantized LLMs using an arbitrary quantization module. The library also features a patched version of the PEFT library for finetuning quantized models through the LP-LoRA method. LLMTools supports a range of LLMs, quantizers, and optimization algorithms, empowering users with modular support for various model configurations. Additionally, LLMTools enables the sharing of all finetuned LLMs on the HuggingFace Hub, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers. The comprehensive documentation provides detailed instructions, examples, and tutorials for easy adoption of the library.
