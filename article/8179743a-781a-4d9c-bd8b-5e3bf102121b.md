## Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey
Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines the power of LLMs with non-parameterized external knowledge bases to improve the performance of large language models. RAG has been shown to significantly enhance answer accuracy, reduce model hallucination, and increase trust in model outputs by providing relevant information from external sources before answering questions. It enables knowledge updates, introduces domain-specific knowledge, and combines the strengths of LLMs and external knowledge bases. This paper reviews the development paradigms, components, evaluation methods, and potential future research directions of RAG.
