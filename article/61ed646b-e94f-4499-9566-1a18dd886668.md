## Use images in RAG with LangChain for multimodal learning
Summary: In the near future, multimodal LLMs are predicted to be the prominent tool for AI projects. Multimodal LLM has three distinct ways to incorporate images into RAG with LangChain: utilizing multimodal embeddings to embed texts and images, employing multimodal LLM to generate text summaries from pictures, and using multimodal LLM to generate text summaries from images while referencing the original picture.
