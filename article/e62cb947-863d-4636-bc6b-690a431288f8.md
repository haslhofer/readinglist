## Practical Steps to Reduce Hallucination and Improve Performance of Systems Built with Large Language Models
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or nonfactual outputs, a phenomenon known as hallucination. To address this issue, practical steps can be taken: lowering the LLM's temperature and providing context to reduce hallucination, decomposing complex prompts into steps, utilizing self-consistency from diverse model outputs, questioning whether models truly understand their own knowledge, and implementing defensive systems with checks and controls to accommodate limitations.
