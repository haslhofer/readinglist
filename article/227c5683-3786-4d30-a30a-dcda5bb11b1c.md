## The Hands-on LLMs FREE course recently surpassed 750+ GitHub ‚≠êüåü‚≠ê. This course teaches how to build hands-on LLM systems using LLMOps principles.
Summary: Paul Iusztin, a senior machine learning engineer, MLOps specialist, and independent contractor, announced that his "Hands-on LLMs" course has surpassed 750 GitHub stars. This free course, led by Iusztin and collaborators Pau Labarta and Alexandru Razvant, focuses on the practical application of building and deploying large language models (LLMs) while adhering to LLMOps principles.

The course consists of four video lessons and open-source code, aiming to teach participants how to construct a complete operational product that leverages LLMs, LLMOps, and a 3-pipeline design. This product will serve as a chatbot that provides financial advice based on real-time financial news. The three components participants will learn to build include a real-time streaming pipeline that monitors financial news, a fine-tuning pipeline that enhances the LLM's accuracy on financial data, and an inference pipeline that enables the LLM to answer financial questions using retrieved news articles. These pipelines are independently developed, deployed, and scaled to ensure modularity and clean code.

The course is targeted towards professionals in machine learning engineering, data engineering, data science, and software engineering who wish to gain expertise in engineering LLM systems using LLMOps principles. The course materials include four hands-on video lessons and open-source code accessible on GitHub.

Iusztin expressed his gratitude for the course's popularity, acknowledging the contributions of Labarta and Razvant in making the course possible. He also outlined the course's curriculum, emphasizing the focus on engineering and MLOps aspects instead of mere demonstrations of predictions in notebooks. Participants will gain hands-on experience in developing, deploying, and scaling modular and clean code pipelines.

The course also introduces various serverless tools, including Comet ML as the ML platform, Qdrant as the vector database, and Beam as the infrastructure. Iusztin encouraged individuals to follow his weekly newsletter for regular lessons on MLE and MLOps and invited them to join his upcoming webinar on comparing training experiments effectively.
