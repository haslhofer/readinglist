## Vector Database Selection Criteria for Customer Finding Product
Summary: The author recently had to select a vector database for their customer finding product. In order to make an informed decision, they considered several factors, including deployment options (both open-source and cloud), ease of use (clear documentation and getting started guides), support (quick and well-organized), and features (filtering, index swap, and token search capabilities). After evaluating several options, they chose Qdrant, which met all of their criteria and has so far exceeded expectations in terms of features, performance, and support.
