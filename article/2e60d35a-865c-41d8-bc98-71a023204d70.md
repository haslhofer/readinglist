## Hugging Face releases user-friendly interface for fine-tuning large language models with ease
Summary: Hugging Face has introduced a user-friendly interface for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) called AutoTrain. Anyone can now fine-tune virtually any LLM available on the Hugging Face Hub with just a few clicks. This tool simplifies the fine-tuning process by providing a user interface for uploading datasets, selecting hyperparameters, and monitoring training progress. The models are privately saved to the user's account, and billing is based on per-minute training time.
