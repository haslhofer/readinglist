## CLIPPO: Image-and-Language Understanding from Pixels Only
Summary: CLIPPO is a unified model for image-and-language understanding trained with contrastive loss, using a single encoder that processes regular images and text rendered as images. It achieves competitive performance on image-based tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot image classification, with half the number of parameters compared to CLIP, and demonstrates strong results on natural language understanding tasks without word-level loss. CLIPPO can also perform visual question answering by simply rendering the question and image together, and it achieves strong performance on multilingual multimodal retrieval without modifications, showcasing its potential for cross-lingual applications.
