## ChatGPT's Performance on an MBA Exam Raises Concerns about the Future of Business Education
Summary: A Wharton School of Business professor, Christian Terwiesch, conducted a study to evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a typical MBA core course final exam in Operations Management. The AI chatbot displayed impressive capabilities in basic operations management and process analysis questions, including those based on case studies. However, ChatGPT had shortcomings in handling more advanced process analysis questions and received a B to B- grade on the exam. Terwiesch expressed concern that the automation of skills taught in MBA programs through the use of AI tools like ChatGPT could potentially reduce the value of an MBA education.
