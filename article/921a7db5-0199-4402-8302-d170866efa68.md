## CarperAI, an EleutherAI research lab, plans to democratize instruction-tuning of large language models by releasing the first open-source LLM trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
Summary: CarperAI, an EleutherAI lab, intends to democratize the instruction-tuning technique for large language models (LLMs) by releasing the first open-source model trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This effort involves collaborating with experts in training LLMs, data labeling, and human annotation to create an LLM that can understand and follow human instructions accurately and safely. The open-source release aims to enable researchers, hobbyists, and smaller companies to conduct studies, build upon state-of-the-art models, and facilitate new applications and innovations.
