## Open Source Text-to-Speech System Built by Inverting Whisper
Summary: WhisperSpeech is an open-source text-to-speech system built on top of Whisper, EnCodec, and Vocos models. The system uses Whisper to generate semantic tokens from audio, EnCodec to model acoustic tokens, and Vocos to generate high-quality audio from EnCodec tokens. WhisperSpeech is designed to be powerful and easily customizable, and it is currently trained on the English LibreLight dataset. Future releases will target multiple languages.
