## Battle of Language Models: Lit-LLaMA vs GPT3.5 vs Bloom vs ...
Summary: In a comparison of several large language models (LLMs), GPT-3 and GPT-4 outperformed the rest in terms of response quality, speed, ease of use, and naturalness. Open-source models, especially Flan-t5, answered questions accurately but lacked humor. Models under the OpenRail License were good but had usage restrictions. Lit-LLaMA and LLaMA were impressive but relied on quoting the article for context and struggled with original jokes. Private models like GPT3 and GPT4 excelled in providing detailed summaries and humor but came with a price and were not ideal for sensitive information. The performance of these models varied depending on the context and phrasing of the questions. Overall, LLMs are becoming powerful tools in various applications as they continue to improve.
