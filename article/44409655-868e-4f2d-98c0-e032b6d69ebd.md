## Open-Source OpenChatKit Released: Powerful Chatbot Platform with a Set of Tools and Processes for Ongoing Improvements
Summary: Together released OpenChatKit, an open-source toolkit for building specialized and general-purpose chatbots. OpenChatKit contains a base chatbot, customization recipes for fine-tuning, an extensible retrieval system for integrating live-updating information, and a moderation model for filtering inappropriate questions. The base chatbot is built on EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX-20B model, fine-tuned with 43 million instructions. Users can provide feedback on the chatbot through a Hugging Face app, which helps improve the model and contribute to the growing corpus of open training data. OpenChatKit is designed to be community-driven and encourages collaboration for ongoing improvement.
