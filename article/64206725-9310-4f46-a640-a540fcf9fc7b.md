## **Open-Source LLMs: A Comprehensive Guide for Developers**
Summary: The Large Language Model (LLM) course is divided into three sections:

**LLM Fundamentals**
Covers mathematical concepts, Python, and neural networks essential for machine learning.

**LLM Scientist**
Focuses on building optimal LLMs using advanced techniques, including LLM architecture, instruction dataset creation, pre-training models, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation.

**LLM Engineer**
Teaches how to develop LLM-based applications for deployment, covering LLM execution, vector storage, retrieval augmented generation, inference optimization, and securing LLMs.
