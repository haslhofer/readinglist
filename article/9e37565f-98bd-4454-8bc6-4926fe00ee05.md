## X-Turing: Leverage the Power of Fine-Tuned LLMs at Your Fingertips
Summary: xTuring is a platform that enables users to fine-tune and utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) such as LLaMA, GPT-J, and Galactica. With its intuitive interface, users can fine-tune LLMs with their own data, improving their performance on specific tasks. The process can be conducted locally or on private cloud infrastructure, prioritizing data privacy and security. xTuring's capabilities include data ingestion, preprocessing, fine-tuning with various methods, evaluation, and support for different models. Additionally, it offers integration with deep learning frameworks, a CLI playground, and a UI interface for ease of use.
