## Using Large Language Models to Develop GitHub Copilot
Summary: GitHub developers share their experiences working with OpenAI's large language model (LLM), which led to the creation of GitHub Copilot. Initially surprised by the model's emergent behavior, they saw its potential for code generation. They obtained an API from OpenAI and assessed the model's capabilities by giving it coding tasks. As the models improved, they explored how to harness their power, leading to the development of GitHub Copilot as an AI-powered chatbot for developers. To further refine the model, the team implemented prompt crafting and fine-tuning techniques. Generative AI and LLMs' impact on developer productivity is highlighted, with GitHub Copilot X emerging as a vision for an AI-powered developer experience beyond the IDE.
