## Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention
Summary: The LLaMA-Adapter repository provides code for efficiently fine-tuning the LLaMA language model using the zero-init attention technique. This approach allows for rapid adaptation of LLaMA to specific tasks with limited data and computational resources. The repository also includes code for training a parameter-efficient Visual Instruction model using LLaMA-Adapter, which demonstrates strong performance on tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
