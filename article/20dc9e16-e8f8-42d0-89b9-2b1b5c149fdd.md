## CLIPPO: A Unified Image-and-Language Model Trained Only with Pixels
Summary: CLIPPO, a unified multimodal model, utilizes a single encoder to process both regular images and text rendered as images. Trained with contrastive loss, CLIPPO performs image-based tasks competitively, requires fewer parameters, and excels in natural language understanding tasks without word-level loss. Additionally, it demonstrates strong performance on multilingual multimodal retrieval without modifications.
