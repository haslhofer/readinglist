## How to Fine-Tune Large Language Models with Amazon SageMaker and PyTorch FSDP
Summary: This tutorial demonstrates how to scale large language model (LLM) workloads to 20 billion parameters or more using Amazon SageMaker, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP). It covers setting up the environment, loading and preparing the chat dataset, and fine-tuning the GPT model using FSDP on Amazon SageMaker. The article highlights the benefits of PyTorch FSDP for efficient large-scale training of LLMs, including transformer wrapping policy, mixed precision, activation checkpointing, and full sharding strategy. The tutorial also guides users through the process of installing Hugging Face Libraries, accessing an IAM Role with the required permissions for SageMaker, and preparing the dataset for fine-tuning. It includes code snippets for tokenizing and chunking the dataset, uploading it to S3, and creating a SageMaker training job using the HuggingFace Estimator. Additionally, it discusses the cost implications of training LLMs on Amazon SageMaker and provides suggestions for optimizing costs.
