## Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models: A Survey of Research Progress and Directions
Summary: The paper, titled "Large Language Models on Graphs," and its companion paper, "Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs," recommend leveraging knowledge graphs to improve the reliability and practicality of large language models (LLMs) in production settings. By combining research progress and directions from both papers, readers can gain a comprehensive understanding of making LLM more reliable and practical for real-world applications. Concepts like knowledge graphs, responsible AI, and unifying LLMs with knowledge graphs are explored to enhance the development and deployment of LLM technology.
