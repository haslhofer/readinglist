## DeepSpeed-Chat: Easy, Fast, and Affordable RLHF Training of ChatGPT-like Models at All Scales
Summary: DeepSpeed Chat, a recently released open-source toolkit, provides an easy-to-use training and inference experience for creating ChatGPT-like models. It features a single script that guides users through the three steps of InstructGPT training, an inference API for testing conversational interactions, a DeepSpeed-RLHF pipeline that mirrors the InstructGPT training process, and a DeepSpeed-RLHF system that combines DeepSpeed's training and inference capabilities into a unified Hybrid Engine. The system efficiently supports models with hundreds of billions of parameters, making it accessible even on single GPUs. DeepSpeed-HE is exceptionally efficient, enabling training of large models at a fraction of the cost compared to existing systems. It achieves significant speedup and scalability, supporting models with up to 175 billion parameters. DeepSpeed Chat is part of the DeepSpeed ecosystem, which offers tutorials, documentation, and a supportive community.
