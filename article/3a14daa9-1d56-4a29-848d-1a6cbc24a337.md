## Mask2Former and OneFormer: Universal Image Segmentation Models Now Available in Transformers
Summary: Mask2Former and OneFormer are state-of-the-art neural networks for image segmentation that can handle instance, semantic, and panoptic segmentation tasks. They use a unified architecture and the "binary mask classification" paradigm, which has proven effective for both instance and semantic segmentation. These models are available in the Hugging Face Transformers library, making them easy to use for inference and fine-tuning on custom datasets.
