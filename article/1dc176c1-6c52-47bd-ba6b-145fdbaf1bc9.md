## New Platform Allows for Easier, Cheaper, and Safer Interactions with Large Language Models
Summary: Researchers from ETH Zurich developed an open-source platform and programming language called LMQL (Language Model Query Language) to enable easier, cheaper, and safer interactions with large language models like ChatGPT. By combining natural and programming languages, LMQL gives users more control over the language model's behavior, allowing for efficient and precise interactions, even for those with limited coding experience. The language includes features for expressing safety constraints and preventing unwanted outputs, making it more transparent and accessible for various users. This platform is especially useful for researchers across disciplines and advanced users seeking to build programs interacting with large language models.
