## The future of AI: "GPT-You" not "GPT-X"
Summary: In the near future, people will be utilizing foundation models (FMs) trained on their own data and workloads. Closed APIs are not secure. Proprietary data will serve as a durable moat, with data development generating substantial value. Fine-tuning outperforms zero-shot learning/prompt approaches, and while pre-training generates value, the last mile extracts it. Ultimately, the future will be characterized by "GPT-You," not "GPT-X."
