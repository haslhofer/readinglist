## Langflow: An effortless way to experiment and prototype LangChain pipelines
Summary: Langflow is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows. It enables you to drag sidebar components onto the canvas and connect them to create your pipeline. Langflow provides various LangChain components, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains. Once you're done, you can export your flow as a JSON file to use with LangChain.
