## Google Brain and Tel Aviv Researchers Propose Text-to-Image Model Guided by Sketches
Summary: Researchers from Google Brain and Tel Aviv University have developed a novel text-to-image model guided by sketches. This model utilizes a Latent Edge Predictor (LEP) to map the internal activations of a pre-trained diffusion model network into spatial edge maps, allowing for the generation of realistic images that adhere to the sketch outline. The sketch-guided text-to-image synthesis process starts with a latent image representation and involves consecutive denoising steps, where the LEP predicts a sketch based on the internal activations. The model produces natural images aligned with the desired sketch, demonstrating impressive results and versatility in handling various use cases.
