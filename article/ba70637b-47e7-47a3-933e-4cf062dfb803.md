## Docker Acquires AtomicJar, Shifting Testing Further Left in the Development Process
Summary: Docker's acquisition of AtomicJar signifies a shift towards "Shifting Left," where testing and quality assurance are integrated earlier in the development cycle. This approach, enabled by Docker's platform, streamlines the process of creating and running tests in isolated environments, resulting in faster feedback loops and improved software quality.
