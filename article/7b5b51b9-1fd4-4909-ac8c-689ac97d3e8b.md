## Meta AI unveils data2vec 2.0: an efficient self-supervised algorithm for computer vision, speech, and text
Summary: Meta AI has developed a highly efficient self-supervised learning algorithm called data2vec 2.0 that can learn from different modalities such as speech, vision, and text with equal efficiency. It outperforms its predecessor, data2vec, in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving the same accuracy as popular existing algorithms but doing so significantly faster. The code and pretrained models are available for further research and application.
