## Large language models like OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT are emerging as the missing piece for user interfaces that adapt to humans, creating a new mental model requiring wholly new methods of interaction.
Summary: Microsoft Copilot is a new AI-powered tool designed to augment human potential and assist users in various productivity tasks within the Microsoft 365 apps. The tool uses large language models (LLMs) to help users generate various content, organize meetings, or extract key points from documents. Copilot's UX is designed to empower users with appropriate trust, providing guidance and control while acknowledging the limitations of the AI. Microsoft emphasizes the importance of education and training to ensure users understand the capabilities and limitations of the tool, preventing over-reliance. The visual identity uses colors and icons to differentiate Copilot-generated content and promote collaboration and ethical considerations. To accommodate the evolving nature of AI technology, Microsoft employs agile design and engineering processes to incorporate new research insights and customer feedback. The company plans to share learnings and updates as the tool develops, inviting feedback from users and the design community.
