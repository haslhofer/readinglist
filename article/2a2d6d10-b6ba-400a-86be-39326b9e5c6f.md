## Run advanced language AI models locally using the dalai library
Summary: A tutorial on running state-of-the-art large language models on a local computer is presented. LLAMA and Alpaca models can be used for this purpose and they can match the performance of models like GPT-3, even though LLAMA is 13x smaller. This is made possible by the dalai library.
