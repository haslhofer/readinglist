## ToolLLM: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master 16000+ Real-world APIs
Summary: ToolLLM is a general framework for facilitating large language models (LLMs) in mastering real-world APIs. It solves the significant limitations of open-source LLMs in tool-use capabilities. It introduces ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, constructed automatically using ChatGPT. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, ToolLLM develops a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. The framework also includes ToolEval, an automatic evaluator for tool-use capabilities of LLMs. Through experiments, ToolLLM effectively fine-tunes LLMs, enabling them to execute complex instructions, generalize to unseen APIs, and achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT.
