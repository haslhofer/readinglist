## Amazon SageMaker and PyTorch FSDP enable efficient training of LLMs such as GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B with Hugging Face Transformers
Summary: This article discusses how to scale large language model (LLM) workloads to 20 billion parameters and beyond using Amazon SageMaker, Hugging Face, and PyTorch FSDP. The author explains what PyTorch FSDP is and how it can be used to efficiently train LLMs on a multi-node, multi-GPU setup. The article also provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Amazon SageMaker and PyTorch FSDP to fine-tune a GPT model on the ELI5 dataset, including preprocessing the data, setting up the training environment, and launching the training job. The author concludes by discussing the cost and benefits of using Amazon SageMaker and PyTorch FSDP for LLM training.
