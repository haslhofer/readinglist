## PyLLMs: Minimal Python Library for Connecting to LLMs with Benchmarking
Summary: PyLLMs is a Python library that allows users to connect to various large language models (LLMs), including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, AI21, Cohere, Aleph Alpha, HuggingfaceHub, and Google. It features an automated benchmark system to evaluate models based on quality, speed, and cost. Additionally, PyLLMs supports multi-model usage, async completions, and streaming from compatible models, making it ideal for fast prototyping and evaluating different models.
