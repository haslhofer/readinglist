## Auto-Encoder: An Unsupervised Artificial Neural Network for Data Compression and Reconstruction
Summary: Autoencoders are unsupervised artificial neural networks designed to learn efficient data compression and reconstruction. They consist of an encoder that reduces data dimensions, a bottleneck layer with the lowest possible data representation, a decoder that reconstructs data from the encoded representation, and a reconstruction loss function to measure the decoder's performance. Common use cases include dimensionality reduction, denoising, and anomaly detection.
