## Hugging Face unveils Ultra fast ControlNet with ðŸ§¨ Diffusers
Summary: ControlNet, introduced by Lvmin Zhang and Maneesh Agrawala, provides a controllable framework for generating images using diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. ControlNet can condition the generation process with spatial contexts like depth maps, segmentation maps, scribbles, or keypoints. This blog post demonstrates the features and usage of the StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline in Diffusers, allowing users to leverage ControlNet for various conditioning applications. Examples include turning a cartoon drawing into a realistic photo, using it for interior design, or transforming a sketch into an artistic drawing. To achieve fast and memory-efficient inference, the pipeline incorporates techniques like UniPCMultistepScheduler, CPU offloading, and xformer optimizations. The blog also explores combining multiple ControlNet conditionings for a single image generation and provides links to model documentation for additional conditioning types. The integration of ControlNet in Diffusers empowers users to create more controlled and detailed image generations, opening up new possibilities for creative exploration and practical applications.
