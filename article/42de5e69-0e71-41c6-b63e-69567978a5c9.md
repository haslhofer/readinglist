## CLIP-Pixels Only: A Unified Model for Image, Text, and Multimodal Understanding
Summary: CLIPPO, a novel approach in image-and-language understanding, employs a single pixel-based model to perform various tasks, including image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, natural language understanding, and visual question answering. It achieves impressive results in these tasks without employing text-specific components, highlighting the potential of a unified architecture for multimodal tasks. Additionally, CLIPPO showcases its multilingual multimodal retrieval capability without requiring a tokenizer, making it a versatile model for cross-lingual understanding.
