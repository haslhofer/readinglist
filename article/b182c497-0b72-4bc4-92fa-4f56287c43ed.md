## PrivateGPT: 100% Private AI Tool for Document-Aware Conversations
Summary: PrivateGPT is a production-ready AI project that allows you to ask questions about your documents using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), even in scenarios without an Internet connection. It provides an API offering all the primitives required to build private, context-aware AI applications. It is now evolving towards becoming a gateway to generative AI models and primitives, including completions, document ingestion, RAG pipelines, and other low-level building blocks.
