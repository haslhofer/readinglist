## Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365: An AI-powered tool that enhances productivity by coordinating AI models with Microsoft 365 apps.
Summary: Copilot for Microsoft 365 is an AI-powered tool that uses LLMs, content from Microsoft Graph, and various apps to assist users. It uses pre-trained models like GPT-4 to generate text and content, coordinate tasks, and generate responses. To function, it receives an input prompt from a user, processes it through "grounding" to make answers more specific and actionable, and sends it to the LLM for processing. The response from the LLM is then post-processed, reviewed by the responsible AI team, and sent back to the app for review by the user.
