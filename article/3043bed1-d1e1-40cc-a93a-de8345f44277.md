## NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis
Summary: The paper presents a novel method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes, called NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields). NeRF optimizes a continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views, represented by a fully-connected deep network. The network takes a 5D coordinate (spatial location and viewing direction) as input and outputs the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. Views are synthesized by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and using classic volume rendering techniques. Optimization is performed using a set of images with known camera poses, resulting in photorealistic novel views with complicated geometry and appearance.
