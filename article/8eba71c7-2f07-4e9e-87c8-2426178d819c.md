## Google and Tel Aviv Researchers Introduce a Method for Guiding Text-to-Image Models with Sketches
Summary: Researchers from Google Brain and Tel Aviv University proposed a new technique for guiding the inference process of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with an edge predictor that operates on the internal activations of the diffusion model's core network. This method, called Latent Edge Predictor (LEP), enables the generation of highly detailed images that adhere to a reference sketch with impressive realism and edge fidelity. The LEP is trained with a small volume of data and performs well on various use cases, such as balancing realism and edge fidelity, and handling different stroke importance levels.
