## Fine-tuning Llama 2 with DPO simplifies training LLMs using preference data
Summary: Hugging Face introduces a new method called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using human feedback. DPO simplifies the typical RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) pipeline by directly optimizing the LLM on preference data via a binary cross-entropy loss. This eliminates the need for a reward model and the complex RL optimization process. Embracing the benefits of TRL and other libraries, Hugging Face demonstrates how to train a 7B-parameter Llama v2 model with DPO on the stack-exchange preference dataset, achieving promising results. This development eases the alignment of LLMs with human preferences, making them more effective and appropriate for real-world applications.
