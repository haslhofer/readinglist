## PowerInfer: A GPU-CPU Hybrid Inference Engine for Large Language Models
Summary: The article discusses a new GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine called PowerInfer, which significantly speeds up inference for large language models (LLMs). This engine exploits the locality in LLM inference by preloading hot-activated neurons onto the GPU and computing cold-activated neurons on the CPU. It achieves impressive token generation rates on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, outperforming server-grade GPUs and other inference engines. This innovation allows for efficient deployment of LLMs locally, opening up new possibilities for applications and research.
