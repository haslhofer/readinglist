## FrugalGPT: Reducing Cost and Improving Performance When Using Large Language Models
Summary: The paper presents strategies for reducing costs and improving performance while using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, and J1-Jumbo. The authors propose FrugalGPT, which combines multiple LLMs to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. Experiments show that FrugalGPT can achieve comparable or better performance than the top individual LLM, demonstrating the potential for sustainable and efficient LLM usage.
