## Decoupled Diffusion Model Unifies Layout Generation with Conditional and Unconditional Synthesis
Summary: Layout Diffusion Generative Model (LDGM) is a unified model for layout generation that handles both conditional and unconditional generation. LDGM views incomplete layouts as intermediate diffusion states and decouples the diffusion processes for different attributes to enhance sample diversity. It learns to reverse the diffusion process jointly, leveraging global contexts for improved generation. LDGM outperforms existing models in functionality and performance, demonstrating its ability to generate layouts either from scratch or conditionally on various available attributes, addressing the challenges of unifying layout generation subtasks.
