## Practical Steps to Mitigate Hallucinations and Enhance Performance of Systems Utilizing Large Language Models
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to producing nonsensical or incorrect output, known as hallucination, which is particularly problematic in non-creative tasks such as search. To address this issue, practical steps can be taken, such as lowering the temperature and providing context to reduce hallucination, decomposing complex prompts into manageable steps, verifying self-consistency among diverse model outputs, enabling models to identify the limits of their knowledge, and implementing defensive systems for error checking and explanations.
