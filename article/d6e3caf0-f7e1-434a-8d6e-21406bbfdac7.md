## How to Create and Track an Advanced Local RAG System Using Mistral 7b, LlamaIndex, and Weights & Biases
Summary: The article discusses the process of building an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system locally. It begins by setting up the environment, loading documents for experiments, installing the LlamaIndex library, and configuring a local LLM (Llama.cpp). The article then demonstrates how to evaluate the system's performance in terms of faithfulness and relevancy, implement advanced RAG techniques such as hierarchical nodes and re-ranking, and track experiments end-to-end using Weights & Biases (W&B) for comparison of results. The complete code for the local RAG system is available on GitHub.
