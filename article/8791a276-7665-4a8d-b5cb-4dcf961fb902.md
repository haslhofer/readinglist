## Together Releases OpenChatKit: A Collaborative Open-Source Project for Chatbot Development
Summary: Together released OpenChatKit, an open-source chatbot foundation that serves as the basis for both specialized and general-purpose chatbots. It includes a tuned language model, customization recipes, an extensible retrieval system, and a moderation model. The kit allows community contributions, feedback, and ongoing development. EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX-20B model was fine-tuned for the chatbot, which excels in tasks like text summarization, question answering, text classification, and knowledge-based question answering. OpenChatKit is customizable for specific applications and includes retrieval capabilities for incorporating regularly updated information. A moderation model helps filter inappropriate user input. Together emphasizes sustainability, with the fine-tuning process occurring in a 100% carbon-negative zone of the Together Decentralized Cloud. Feedback and dataset contributions are encouraged through the Hugging Face app and GitHub repository.
