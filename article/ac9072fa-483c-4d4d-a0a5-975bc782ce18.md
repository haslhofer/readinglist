## Guiding Principles for Effective Questioning of Large Language Models
Summary: The paper presents 26 guiding principles for querying large language models (LLMs) effectively. These principles aim to simplify the process of formulating questions and prompts, enabling users to better understand the behaviors of different LLM scales. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1/2 (7B, 13B, and 70B) and GPT-3.5/4 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines in improving instruction and prompt design. The work provides a practical guide for researchers working with LLM prompting.
