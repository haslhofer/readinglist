## Together Releases OpenChatKit, An Open-Source Foundation for Chatbots with Customizable and General-Purpose Applications
Summary: Together has launched OpenChatKit, an open-source base for creating general and specialized chatbots. Developed in collaboration with LAION and Ontocord, it combines a large language model, customization recipes, an extensible retrieval system, and a moderation model. The project aims to provide a foundation for ongoing community improvement, with processes for dataset contributions, feedback incorporation, and a Hugging Face app for user interaction and feedback. It also highlights the use of Together's Decentralized Cloud for training and the green zone for carbon-negative computing.
