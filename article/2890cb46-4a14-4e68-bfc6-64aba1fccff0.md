## ToolQA: A Dataset for Assessing Large Language Models' Ability to Use External Tools for Question Answering
Summary: Researchers from the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, have introduced ToolQA, a benchmark for question-answering that assesses the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in using external resources. ToolQA consists of data from eight domains and defines 13 types of tools that can acquire information from external reference corpora. Experiments showed that LLMs that only rely on internal knowledge have low success rates, while tool-augmented LLMs performed better by using external tools.
