## Researchers Custom-Train Diffusion Models to Generate Personalized Text-to-Image
Summary: Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University, and Adobe Research have developed a fine-tuning technique called Custom Diffusion for text-to-image diffusion models to personalize them for specific concepts without retraining the entire model. This technique enables users to augment existing text-to-image models with new concepts given only a few examples and compose multiple concepts together in novel settings. By fine-tuning only a small subset of model weights, the method is highly efficient and memory-efficient, making it a practical approach for personalizing text-to-image models.
