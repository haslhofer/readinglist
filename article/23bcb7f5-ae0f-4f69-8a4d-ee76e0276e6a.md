## Open-Source Ecosystem for AI Devices with Conversational Voice Interface
Summary: The 01 Project aims to build an open-source ecosystem for AI devices, focusing on an open, modular, and free operating system that can power conversational devices like the Rabbit R1 and Star Trek computers. The project's software can be installed on any device with input, output, and internet connectivity, while the hardware includes the ESP32-based 01 Light and the standalone 01 Heavy. It uses LMC Messages to communicate with system components and exposes a speech-to-speech websocket that allows users to stream raw audio bytes to the LLM for interpretation. Customizable system settings and a roadmap outline the project's future development.
