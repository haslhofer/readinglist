## Deploy Idefics 9B & 80B Visual Language Models on Amazon SageMaker
Summary: An open-access visual language model called IDEFICS can generate text based on pictures and texts. It comes in two sizes: 9B and 80B. You can deploy Idefics to Amazon SageMaker using the Hugging Face LLM DLC. You can set up your development environment, get the new Hugging Face LLM DLC, deploy the model to SageMaker, run inference and chat with it, and clean up afterward. Hardware requirements depend on the model size and instance type.
