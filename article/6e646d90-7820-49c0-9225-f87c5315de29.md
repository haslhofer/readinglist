## Create a Custom ChatGPT with Custom Knowledge Base
Summary: ChatGPT has become a widely used tool for automating tasks, but it has limitations such as providing incorrect answers and lacking context on specific topics. To bridge this gap, users can feed ChatGPT with custom data from various sources like wiki pages, Slack groups, and books. The traditional method of doing this through prompt engineering is limited by the model's context size and manual effort. To overcome these challenges, custom ChatGPT models can be created with custom knowledge bases, allowing users to access more comprehensive and relevant information.
