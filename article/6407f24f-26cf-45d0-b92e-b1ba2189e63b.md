## Web Stable Diffusion: An Open-Source Project for Running Stable Diffusion Models Entirely in Web Browsers
Summary: Web Stable Diffusion is a project that brings stable diffusion models to web browsers. It runs entirely within the browser, without server support, and allows users to create photorealistic images from text prompts. The project uses machine learning compilation (MLC) to optimize the models and build static memory planning optimizations to reuse memory across multiple layers. It also leverages Emscripten and Typescript to build a TVM web runtime that can deploy generated modules. The project offers both WebGPU and native GPU runtime options for deployment, and provides opportunities for advanced optimizations to improve performance.
