Summary: The tech industry is downsizing as 90,000 workers were laid off in 2022, and companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google continue to announce job cuts. The affected employees are selling their shares in tech start-ups, causing valuations to fall further.

The article recommends considering stocks of companies with stable business models and actual profitability.
