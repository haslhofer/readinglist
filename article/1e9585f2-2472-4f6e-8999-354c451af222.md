## Run State-of-the-Art Language Models like ChatGPT on Your Local Computer
Summary: The author explains how to run state-of-the-art large language models on a local computer using the dalai library. The LLaMA model, a foundational language model, and the Alpaca model, a fine-tuned version of LLaMA for instruction-following, are discussed. These models achieve comparable or better results than their GPT counterparts while being small enough to run locally. The LLaMA model outperforms GPT-3 on most benchmarks despite being 13 times smaller. The author mentions that running the LLaMA model on a Raspberry Pi is possible. Originally intended for research, Meta later released model checkpoints, allowing for local usage.
