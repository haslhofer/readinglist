## Visual Programming Framework Unveils Simplified Controllable Responses from Language Models
Summary: Low-code LLM is a novel human-LLM interaction framework that aims to bridge the gap between humans and LLMs. It incorporates six types of simple low-code visual programming interactions into a graphical user interface, enabling users to incorporate their ideas into the workflow without writing complex prompts. The framework consists of a Planning LLM that designs a structured planning workflow for complex tasks and an Executing LLM that generates responses following the user-confirmed workflow. It offers advantages such as controllable generation results, user-friendly human-LLM interaction, and broad applicability.
