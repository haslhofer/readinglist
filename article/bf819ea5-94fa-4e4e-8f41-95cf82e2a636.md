## LangChain collaborates with Mistral AI to improve RAG agents with enhanced control flow and tool-calling capabilities
Summary: LangChain has partnered with Mistral AI to provide a set of cookbooks and a video tutorial demonstrating how to create agents using control flows in LangGraph. These agents leverage ideas from three advanced RAG papers, enabling reliable performance across model scales. Additionally, LangChain introduces a new tool-calling agent that works with larger Mistral AI models and uses structured outputs for enhanced parsing reliability.
