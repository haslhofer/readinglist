## An In-Depth Guide to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models – From Theory to Implementation

Diffusion probabilistic models are an exciting new area of research showing great promise in image generation. In retrospect, diffusion-based generative models were first introduced in 2015 and popularized in 2020 when Ho et al. published the paper “Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models” (DDPMs). DDPMs are responsible for making diffusion models practical. In this article, we will highlight the key concepts and techniques behind DDPMs and train DDPMs from scratch on a “flowers” dataset for unconditional image generation.
Summary: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are a type of generative model that generates new data points by gradually corrupting existing data points until they become pure noise and then reversing the process to generate new data points that resemble the original data. This is done by adding noise to the data in a controlled manner and then learning how to reverse the process. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are a specific type of DPM that has been shown to be very effective for generating high-quality images.

To train a DDPM, we start with a dataset of images. We then add noise to the images in a controlled manner, using a process called the forward diffusion process. This process gradually corrupts the images until they become pure noise. Once the images are pure noise, we can then reverse the process, using a process called the reverse diffusion process. This process gradually removes the noise from the images until they are restored to their original state.

The goal of training a DDPM is to learn the parameters of the forward and reverse diffusion processes. Once the model has learned these parameters, it can be used to generate new images that resemble the original data.

DDPMs have been shown to be very effective for generating high-quality images. They have been used to generate images for a variety of applications, including image editing, computer graphics, and medical imaging.

Here are some of the key advantages of DDPMs:

* They can generate high-quality images.
* They are relatively easy to train.
* They can be used to generate images from a variety of data distributions.

Here are some of the key disadvantages of DDPMs:

* They can be slow to train.
* They can be difficult to tune.
* They can be computationally expensive to use.

Overall, DDPMs are a powerful tool for generating high-quality images. They have a number of advantages over other generative models, but they also have some disadvantages.
