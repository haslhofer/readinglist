## Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions
Summary: Self-Instruct is a framework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained language models by leveraging their own generations. It generates instructions, input, and output samples from the language model, filters invalid or similar ones, and uses them to finetune the original model, resulting in significant performance improvements on various instruction-based tasks, with minimal reliance on human-written instruction data.
