## AI-driven applications to prioritize user experience over model development in 2024
Summary: In the realm of consumer AI, a significant shift from model development to user experience (UX) is expected in 2024. The focus will move from merely building the best models to creating exceptional user experiences that leverage those models effectively. Conversational interfaces and multimodal interactions are gaining prominence, with the potential to redefine user engagement and satisfaction. AR and VR are poised to enhance the immersion and accessibility of AI-powered applications, while the integration of AI into existing products and services will drive wider adoption. To stay competitive, businesses must prioritize UX in their AI initiatives and explore creative ways to integrate AI into their products and services.
