## The GPT-3 Family: From GPT-1 to ChatGPT and Beyond
Summary: The evolution of the GPT model family, from GPT-1 to GPT-3, has revolutionized the field of large language models (LLMs). GPT-3, in particular, has become synonymous with the public perception of LLMs due to its advanced text generation capabilities. However, there is more to the GPT-3 family than just the core GPT-3 model, with various model sizes and fine-tuned versions for specific applications, including code generation, text summarization, and text-embedding extraction. The GPT-3.5 models, trained on a blend of text and code data, have been used for various applications, including ChatGPT, a sibling model to InstructGPT. Despite the similarities in architecture between GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3, the key differences lie in the data size, number of transformer blocks, and incoming tokens used during training.
