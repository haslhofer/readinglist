## AI Engineers Taught to Build RAG from Scratch
Summary: LlamaIndex, a platform for building AI applications, has released a new low-level tutorial series that teaches users how to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models from scratch using only the platform's low-level components, such as data ingestion, retrieval, response synthesis, and agent loops. The tutorials cover both data ingestion and retrieval, with plans for advanced topics like response synthesis and agent loops in the future.
