Summary: PrivateGPT, a production-ready AI project, allows users to ask questions about their documents using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), even in scenarios without an internet connection, ensuring complete privacy as no data leaves their execution environment. Additionally, PrivateGPT includes a working Gradio UI client, bulk model download script, ingestion script, and a set of useful tools for testing the API and implementing complex pipelines.
