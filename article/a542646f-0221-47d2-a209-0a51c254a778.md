## Octopus: AI Programmer Decodes Vision, Language, and Executes Complex Actions
Summary: Octopus is an embodied vision-language model (VLM) designed to understand visual and textual task objectives, generate action sequences, and produce executable code. Based on LLaVA and Otter architectures, it operates in OctoVerse, a set of sub-worlds that test Octopus's abilities in various environments (OmniGibson, GTA, MineCraft). Users can access training pipelines, evaluation tools, and citation information for the model. Octopus's proficiency in embodied visual planning and programming highlights the potential of RL-based training for VLM performance.
