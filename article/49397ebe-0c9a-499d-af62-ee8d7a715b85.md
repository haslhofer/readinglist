## Learn How to Create a Custom ChatGPT With Custom Knowledge Base
Summary: Due to the limitations of ChatGPT, such as providing incorrect information and having limited context, there is a need to extend its capabilities. One method is through prompt engineering, where user-specific data is added as context before asking questions. However, this approach is limited by the model's context size, requiring a manual and tedious process to inject large amounts of data. To address this, custom ChatGPT models can be built using OpenAI's GPT-3 API, allowing users to feed their own data sources and train the model with specific information, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
