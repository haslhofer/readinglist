## ViperGPT: A Framework for Composing Vision-and-Language Models into Subroutines via Python Code Generation
Summary: ViperGPT, a framework that merges code-generation models with vision-and-language models, is introduced. ViperGPT uses existing APIs to access modules and then assemble them by generating executable Python code. It achieves state-of-the-art results in various complex visual tasks without requiring additional training.
