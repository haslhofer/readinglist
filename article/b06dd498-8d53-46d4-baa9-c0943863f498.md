## Query Understanding LlamaPack: Empowering Conversational AI Through Language Models
Summary: The provided text describes the "query understanding agent" example within the "Llama Index Packs" project. This example showcases the capabilities of a pre-trained model in understanding the intent of user queries by leveraging large language models. The model can map queries to corresponding intents, enabling more accurate and efficient response generation in downstream applications.
