## TII's Falcon LLMs Outperform Open-Source Competitors; Falcon 7B and 40B Now Available on Hugging Face
Summary: TII, an Abu Dhabi-based technology company, has released two new open-source LLMs, Falcon, with sizes of 7B and 40B, trained on 1.5T and 1T tokens, respectively. Falcon is said to outperform comparable open-source models due to its training on a larger dataset. It uses flashAttention, multi-query Attention, and has a 2048 context window. Licensing allows commercial use but comes with restrictions. Apache 2.0 licensing is now in effect. The models are available on Hugging Face and Github.
