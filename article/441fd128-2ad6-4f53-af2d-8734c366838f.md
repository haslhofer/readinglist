## Digital Artists Use NVIDIA Instant NeRF to Create Immersive 3D Scenes
Summary: NVIDIA Instant NeRF is a tool that allows digital artists to create immersive 3D scenes from static 2D images in minutes. Using a set of photos taken from different perspectives, the tool generates a neural radiance field (NeRF) that represents the scene in 3D. This NeRF can then be used to render the scene from any viewpoint, allowing users to explore and interact with it realistically. The tool has been used to create beautiful and immersive scenes that can be used for a variety of applications, including online libraries, museums, virtual-reality experiences, and heritage-conservation projects.
