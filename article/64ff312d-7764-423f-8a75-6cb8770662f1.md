## Data Pre-Processing is Crucial for AI Applications Powered by Large Language Models
Summary: When utilizing large language models (LLMs), data pre-processing, such as efficiently extracting relevant information and removing unnecessary data from large datasets, is essential to optimize model performance and avoid costly and unnecessary computation. The specific data pre-processing steps may vary depending on the use case, but generally involve data cleaning, feature engineering, and tokenization to convert text data into a format suitable for analysis. This process ensures that the data fed into the LLM is targeted and relevant, leading to more accurate and efficient model outputs.
