## The Hands-On LLMs course, created by Paul Iusztin, Pau Labarta, and Alexandru Răzvanț, has surpassed 750 GitHub stars. The free course teaches how to build hands-on LLM systems using good LLMOps principles, focusing on engineering and MLOps aspects.
Summary: The Hands-on LLM course, provided without charge, recently surpassed 750+ GitHub stars. This course is designed for individuals seeking to learn how to construct hands-on LLM systems using LLMOps best practices. With a comprehensive set of video lessons and open-source code, the course offers participants the opportunity to build a fully operational product that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), LLMOps, and the 3-pipeline design to create a chatbot capable of providing financial investment advice.

The curriculum centers around the engineering and MLOps aspects of LLM systems, as opposed to mere demonstrations of how to make predictions in a notebook. By the end of the course, participants will have constructed three distinct components: a real-time streaming pipeline responsible for listening to financial news, cleaning and embedding documents, and loading them into a vector database; a fine-tuning pipeline deployed as a serverless continuous training system that fine-tunes an LLM on financial data while utilizing QLoRA, monitoring experiments with an experiment tracker, and saving the optimal model to a model registry; and an inference pipeline built in LangChain, deployed as a serverless RESTful API, tasked with loading the fine-tuned LLM from the model registry and generating responses to financial inquiries by leveraging the vector database populated with financial news in real-time.

The course is suitable for individuals with backgrounds in MLE, DE, DS, or SWE who are interested in learning how to engineer LLM systems guided by LLMOps principles. The learning process is facilitated by four hands-on video lessons accompanied by open-source code accessible on GitHub.

The course creators, Paul Iusztin, Pau Labarta, and Alexandru Razvant, have expressed gratitude for the support and collaboration that made this course possible. Participants are encouraged to check out the course, support the initiative with a star, and follow Paul Iusztin for daily lessons on ML engineering and MLOps.
