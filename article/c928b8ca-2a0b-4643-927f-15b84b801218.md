## Reference Resolution Converted into Language Modeling with Impressive Gains
Summary: Reference resolution, crucial for understanding context, has been underutilized with Language Large Models (LLMs). This paper introduces ReALM, an LLM-based system that converts reference resolution into a language modeling problem, effectively handling various reference types, including non-conversational entities. ReALM significantly outperforms existing systems and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 with its smallest model, demonstrating the potential of LLMs for reference resolution.
