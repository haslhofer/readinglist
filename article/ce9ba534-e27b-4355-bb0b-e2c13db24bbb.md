## An In-Depth Guide to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models â€“ From Theory to Implementation
Summary: Researchers in the field of artificial intelligence have shown considerable interest in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, or DDPMs, have become the standard approach. Ho et al. published the paper "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (DDPMs) in 2020. DDPMs have proven to be highly practical and are credited with making diffusion models practical. This paper discusses the core ideas and methods behind DDPMs. These models are trained from scratch on a "flowers" dataset to generate images without conditions. The authors discuss the mathematical and theoretical aspects of denoising diffusion probabilistic models in this paper. They introduce the essential concepts in diffusion-based generative models, which are a class of models based on a concept from non-equilibrium statistical physics, are created by a process combining two opposing processes: the forward and reverse diffusion processes. In the forward process, the dataset images are gradually corrupted through iterations, resulting in a change from their original subspace to a simple distribution, which allows for an easier sampling process. The reverse process involves restoring the images to their original subspace by iteratively removing the noise introduced in the forward process. The authors also discuss the loss function used in DDPMs, which is derived from variational lower bounding. They then present code for implementing DDPMs from scratch in PyTorch, including the model architecture and training and sampling algorithms. The authors use visualization techniques to illustrate the forward and reverse diffusion processes. They also provide results from training and sampling experiments on different datasets, demonstrating the model's ability to generate diverse and realistic images. Finally, they conclude by highlighting the potential of DDPMs and the exciting possibilities they present for future research in generative modeling.
