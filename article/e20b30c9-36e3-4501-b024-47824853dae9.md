## Gorilla: A Finetuned Large Language Model for Effective API Utilization
Summary: The research paper titled "Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs" presents Gorilla, a fine-tuned LLaMA-based model that outperforms state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 in writing API calls. Gorilla is designed to effectively use tools via API calls, mitigating hallucination issues commonly encountered when prompting LLMs directly. The model is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of APIs and demonstrates a strong capability to adapt to test-time document changes. The successful integration of a retrieval system with Gorilla showcases the potential for LLMs to utilize tools more accurately, enhancing the reliability and applicability of their outputs.
