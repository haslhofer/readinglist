## Deploy FLAN-T5 XXL on Amazon SageMaker
Summary: This blog post focuses on deploying the FLAN-T5-XXL model, a large language model, on Amazon SageMaker for inference. The process involves creating an inference script, packaging it with the model weights into a model.tar.gz archive, deploying the model to SageMaker using the HuggingFaceModel class, and running inference using a json payload. It provides detailed instructions, code snippets, and guidance for customizing the inference experience by configuring parameters. The blog also includes examples of different decoding strategies for text generation and question answering. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of cleaning up resources by deleting the model and endpoint.
